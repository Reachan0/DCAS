It will be assumed that bound TGFb1 is\nunavailable for regulation of cell function and that only unbound, or \"free\", TGFb1 is\ninvolved in cell regulation. You are a researcher exploring the consequences of this new\nfinding with the objective of using this fact in the design of new biomaterials-based\napproaches to regeneration.\nA. The researcher is familiar with data (\"contraction-blocking data\") showing that\ncollagen-GAG scaffolds block wound contraction most effectively when the average pore\nsize lies between approximately 20 and 140 μm. See Fig. 1. Having conducted\npreliminary studies you have found out that the mass of bound TGFβ1, m, is directly\nproportional to the specific surface, σ, of a series of scaffolds.\nm = Cσ\nwhere C is a constant of proportionality. The specific surface, σ, of scaffolds is known to\ndepend on the pore size, d, by the following relation (Gibson and Ashby, 1997):\nσ = K/d\nwhere K is a constant of proportionality. Write the relation between the mass of bound\nTGFβ1, m, and the average pore size, d, of a series of scaffolds.\nB. Collagen-GAG scaffolds degrade during implantation. Set up and solve a linear\ndifferential equation with one or more constant coefficients which can be used as a model\nto describe the decay of the mass of bound TGFb1, m, with time of implantation.

Implants to Treat Defects in the Intervertebral Disc.\nThe intervertebral discs (IVD) of the spine are sandwiched between the bone vertebrae\n(Fig. 1a). The IVD is made up of an outer \"annulus fibrosus\" comprised of fibrous tissue with a\nlamellar structure in which the collagen fibers in each lamella are oriented in a particular angle\n(Fig. 1b). Contained within the annulus fibrosus, making up the core of the disc, is the \"nucleus\npulposus,\" which is cartilage (Fig. 1b). The bone and annulus fibrosus are vascularized but the\nnucleus pulposus has no blood vessels. You have been hired by an orthopaedic company\ninterested in developing novel treatments for spine problems.\nA. (10%) Due to trauma, small fissures/fractures/defects can form in the nucleus pulposus,\nannulus fibrosus, and/or in the bone (Fig. 1c). Write 3 interconnected unit cell processes,\ninvolving 3 different cell types, for the acute phase of healing for each of the 3 defects. Name a\nregulator for each process if one is known.\nB. (15%) The company is considering the development of treatments for each of the 3 small\ndefects in Fig. 1c. Which of the elements of tissue engineering/regenerative medicine (scaffolds,\ncells, regulators), if any, would you suggest are the most essential for implantation or injection\ninto each of the 3 defects to facilitate the most favorable reparative response. You can name\nmore than one element, but there must be a compelling rationale. Explain your answers.\nC. (15%) In certain disease conditions it is necessary to remove a portion of degenerated\nannulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus, in a procedure referred to as discectomy (Fig. 1b). One\nproposed method of treatment is to implant a permanent, nonporous silicone rubber device which\nhas the same shape as the defect and compressive properties that are similar to the resected tissue.\n(1) What are two principal issues which would have to be addressed relative to this\napproach?\n(2) When this procedure was performed in an animal model it as found that a layer of\nmacrophages was on the silicone samples when they were retrieved after 6 months. One of your\ncolleagues has notified the CEO that this is cause to search for another elastomeric polymer for\nthis application, because the presence of the macrophages indicates that the silicone rubber being\nused is not biocompatible. Do you agree? Explain.\n(3) When the silicone sample (above) was removed from the animal it was found to be\nencapsulated in a layer of tissue a few millimeters thick. Write the unit cell process(es) related to\nthe formation of this tissue capsule.\n\nD. (20%) As an alternative approach to the treatment of the defect in Fig. 1b, your company has\ndeveloped a sponge-like absorbable scaffold to fill the defect to facilitate regeneration. The least\nexpensive approach would be to have a one-piece sponge-like scaffold fill the defect.\n(1) What would you expect the outcome of this procedure to be relative to the growth of\nnucleus pulposus and annulus fibrosus tissue into the scaffold?\n(2) Would there be any benefit to applying laminin on the walls of the scaffold prior to\nits implantation?\n(3) Would there be any benefit to poking holes through the ends of the bone above and\nbelow the defect prior to implanting the scaffold?\nE. (10%) A prosthesis is being investigated to replace the entire degenerated intervertebral disc,\nafter it is removed (Fig. 1d). The metal endplates of the metal-plastic (polyethylene)-metal\ndevice have porous metal coatings to accommodate bone ingrowth for fixation (Fig. 1d).\n(1) Write 3 unit cell processes involved in this bone ingrowth into the coating. Name a\nregulator for each process if one is known.\n(2) In an animal model, a prosthesis recovered after 6 months of implantation had fibrous\ntissue, not bone, in the pores of the coating. What is the likely explanation for this finding.\nF. (10%) During laboratory mechanical testing of the prosthesis in 1.E. (Fig. 1d), it was found\nthat wear particles were released by the polyethylene. One of your colleagues at the firm has the\nopinion that these will not prove to be a problem if generated in vivo because they are so small\n(less than 10 μm in diameter) they will not interfere with function of the spine. Do you agree?\nExplain your answer using unit cell processes.\n\n2 (20%) Loss of Cell-Biomaterial Binding Due to Manufacturing Error during\nPreparation of Biomaterial.\nOne of the intermediate steps of the process for manufacturing a collagen-based scaffold\nsubjects type I collagen (extracted from cow tendon) to a freeze-drying step. During this step the\naqueous suspension of collagen is first frozen and then dried in the frozen state by sublimation of\nthe ice into the vapor state (following application of vacuum). At the end of the freeze drying\nstep the temperature is 25oC and the water content of collagen has dropped down drastically\nfrom about 99% to 5-10% by weight.\nResidual moisture is further reduced in the next step, high-temperature crosslinking (the\nlast in the manufacturing process). Here, the combination of high temperature, 104oC, and a\nvacuum of 50 torr (1 torr = 133Pa) removes moisture from the material from about 5-10% down\nto less than 1% over a period of several hours. Removal of the residual moisture below about 2%\nis known to induce covalent crosslinking between chains of collagen. Crosslinking takes place\nprimarily by an amide condensation process involving amino groups and carboxylic groups from\nadjacent chains, as shown below:\n\n-NH2 + -COOH → -NHCO + H2O\nOn a particular day the vacuum pump during the freeze drying step fails and the pressure\nincreases to atmospheric. As a result the sublimation process fails and the material does not\nbecome dehydrated down to the desired level. The moisture content at the end of this failed\nfreeze drying step is now 30%. The ensuing crosslinking step is conducted under normal\nconditions. After the crosslinking step it is observed that the product fails the basic quality\ncontrol test: The scaffold product fails to bind large numbers of fibroblasts on its surface when a\nsmall volume of cells in culture is placed on the surface of a sample of the product. In a normal\nquality control test the cells bind on the surface in very large numbers.\nExplain the failure of the quality control test. To support your answer cite (in very brief,\nsummary form) data from one or more of the articles in the reading assignment. When citing\ndata that support your interpretation mention the complete reference, including author, journal,\ndate, as well as the page number where the cited data is located.\nNOTE 1: Some data on the thermal transitions (melting to gelatin) of type I collagen.\nAt a sufficiently high temperature, collagen melts into gelatin. Gelatin molecules have the same\nsecondary structure as collagen does but they lack the tertiary structure of collagen. The\ntemperature of the transition from collagen to gelatin decreases as the moisture content increases.\nPositive pressure or vacuum at levels near atmospheric pressure do not affect the level of the\nmelting point. Examples of such melting points (Tm, oC) are shown in the Table below:\n% moisture\nTm, oC\n\nNOTE 2: Single-letter amino acid code\n1. G - Glycine (Gly)\n2. P - Proline (Pro)\n3.

Equipment and assays for optimization of regenerative activity scaffolds.\nYou have been appointed to lead a research group at Scaffold Biologicals, a prominent\nmanufacturer of biologically active scaffolds based on collagen-GAG copolymers used in\nregenerative medicine. You now have your first assignment. You have been asked to\nspend a budget of approximately $500K to equip a new laboratory that will support both\nresearch activities and manufacturing. Your first task is to buy some necessary\ninstruments/equipment (I/E) to measure important properties of scaffolds. You also need\nto justify to management the basis of what logic (or data) you have used in making your\nselection.\nSpecifically, you are asked to answer the following questions and, in all cases,\njustify your response with a brief explanation:\nA. Pore size of active scaffolds.\na (10%). Select a piece of I/E to fabricate scaffolds of different pore sizes and explain\nbriefly the basic physical/chemical principle that is utilized during the fabrication\nprocess.\nb (10%). Describe very briefly a study that you will set up to optimize the pore size in\norder to maximize the biological activity of scaffolds, based on selection of a range of\ndesirable pore size. Make sure you have described one assay that you will use to find out\nwhere the optimal point of biological activity lies.\nc (10%). Propose a mechanism based on the scale of a cell or organ (not molecular) that\nexplains the existence of an optimal range in pore size.\nd (10%). The existence of an optimal range in regenerative activity requires that the\nactivity drop both at pore sizes below and those that are above the optimal range. Provide\na molecular explanation for the existence of an optimal range in regenerative activity in\nterms of a specific molecular property of a collagen-GAG scaffold.\nB. Crosslink density of active scaffolds.\na (5%). Select a simple I/E that can be used to measure the density of covalent crosslinks\nof scaffolds by a measurement of mechanical behavior. Describe the chemical/physical\nprinciple behind this measurement.\nb (5%). Describe briefly the variables that need to be controlled in one process of your\nchoice that can be used to adjust the crosslink density to a desired level.\nc (5%). Propose a mechanism based on the scale of a cell or organ (not molecular) that\nexplains the existence of an optimal range in crosslink density.\nC.

Select an I/E that can be used to measure mechanical forces generated by cells in\ncontact with a scaffold in culture. Briefly describe the physical/chemical/biological\nprinciple that underlies force generation.\nb (10%). Describe a series of measurements that can be used to decide whether cells\ngenerate forces independently of each other or whether they act cooperatively.\nc. (5%). Briefly, what is the significance of studying cooperative cell-cell behavior in the\narea of regenerative medicine?\nd (10%). Based on the statistical mechanical model of cell-cell cooperativity described in\nclass, what is the minimum number of other cells that a given cell must cooperate with in\norder for the entire cell assembly to behave in a cooperative manner?\n2. (15%) Evaluation of polymeric biomaterials for their ability to absorb a protein.\nA start-up company is interested in developing polymeric biomaterials that have\nthe capability to bind a specific protein, lubricin (L), which is the principal lubricating\nprotein in the body. In order to test their candidate biomaterials they have conjugated\n(i.e., permanently attached) lubricin molecules to gold particles (Fig. 1a), so that they can\nmeasure the amount of gold on the surface as a measure of the amount of lubricin. You\ncan assume that the conjugation of lubricin to the gold nanoparticles has no effect on the\nlubricin molecular confirmation. The adsorption curves in Fig. 1b were the result of an\nexperiment in which 2 candidate biomaterials were immersed into solutions of increasing\nlubricin concentration, after which the amount of gold on the surface was analyzed.\nA) Based on the curves in Fig. 1b would you recommend the selection of A or B based\non the binding affinity and number of binding sites for lubricin? Explain.\nB) In order to check the uniformity of the binding sites on the surfaces of the\nbiomaterials, one of the consultants has proposed using light microscopy to examine the\ndistribution of the gold particles on the surfaces after the adsorption test. Would you\nagree with this method for visualizing the gold particles on the surface; if not what other\nmicroscopy method would you suggest?\nC) Another consultant has proposed that x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS (also\nreferred to as ESCA), which can easily identify gold, be used as the method of\ndetermining the amount of gold on the surface of the biomaterials in these adsorption\ntests.

Design of a study to replace scar with skin.\nYou are working under a very tight budget due to your company's efforts to survive the\nrecession. You are asked to develop a device for regenerating skin in patients who have scars in\ntheir skin of size about 10X10 cm2. Each scar will be removed surgically and your new device\nwill be grafted on the freshly generated skin wound. If your device works, skin will be\nregenerated at the site of the former scar.\nA (10%). Select an animal species with which you will conduct model studies of your candidate\ndevice(s). The animal species you select should have approximately the same scar-forming\nability as the human. As a measure of scar-forming ability you can take the fractional percent of\ninitial area of an experimental skin wound that forms scar asymptotically following injury (Ainf).\nSince the human forms large scars, the asymptotic scar-forming ability of humans (on the back)\nis about 45%. The animal species you select should have an asymptotic scar-forming ability of at\nleast 25%.\nB (10%). Describe the wound model that you will generate in order to test the ability of your\ndevice to replace scar. Explain briefly why you are selecting this wound model.\nC (20%). Consider the following 6 protocols that have been suggested for inducing skin\nregeneration in your animal model at lowest cost. For each candidate protocol provide a\nprediction of its efficacy and explain your answer briefly.\na. Keratinocytes (KC) + dermis regeneration template (DRT) [in vitro]. It is proposed that new\nskin will hypothetically be formed in vitro using these two reactants, followed by grafting on this\nhypothetical skin onto the model wound. DRT is formed by coprecipitating collagen and a\nglycosaminoglycan in acetic acid solution, followed by freeze drying to form a scaffold with\naverage pore size of 100 μm and is crosslinked to give a degradation half-life in vivo of about 14\ndays.\nb. KC in cell culture medium will be pipetted onto the wound [in vivo].\nc. KC + FB will be pipetted into the wound, each cell type to be pipetted in its own cell culture\nmedium [in vivo].\nd. TGFb1 solution will be pipetted on to the skin wound, followed by grafting the wound with\nKC + DRT [in vivo].\ne. KC + dermis regeneration template (DRT) [in vivo]. KC will be seeded into DRT before\ngrafting onto the model skin wound.\nf. Fibroblasts (FB) + KC + DRT [in vivo]. FB and KC will both be seeded into DRT, before\ngrafting onto the model skin wound.\nD (10%). Your budget is tight and you can select one (only one) test that you will use to assay\nthe efficacy of your chosen device(s) to meet your objective of replacing scar with a\n\nphysiological dermis. (Safety will not be studied at this time.). Describe this test briefly in terms\nof the data that it provides which distinguish between scar and dermis. (Do not discuss the basic\nphysics of the laser scattering process.)\n2. (50%). Biomaterials for total knee replacement\nYou have been hired by a medical device company that is in the business of commercializing\nbiomaterials to be used for total knee replacement procedures (Fig. 1). The femoral component\nof knee prostheses (Fig. 1a) is generally fabricated from cobalt-chromium alloy, and the tibial\ncomponent can be made from cobalt-chromium alloy or titanium alloy. The condyles of the\nfemoral component articulate with an ultra high molecular weight polyethylene tibial insert. The\nfemoral component of the prosthesis cannot be made from titanium alloy because of the poor\nwear resistance of titanium.\nA (25%). Figs. 1c show a radiograph obtained from a patient 1 year after implantation of a\nprosthesis (with both components made from cobalt chromium alloy) from a competing\ncompany. The femoral and tibial components were fixed with polymethyl methacrylate\n(PMMA; \"bone cement\"). The orthopaedic surgeon and radiologist have agreed that there are\ncertain regions of abnormal bone loss under the femoral (X) and tibial (Y) components.\n1. (5%) The CEO of your company thought that this bone loss was somehow caused by\nfragmentation of the cement. What mechanism of bone loss would you offer in support\nof such a theory related to breakdown of the cement?\n2. (5%) Careful examination of the tissue obtained from the sites of bone loss after the\nimplant was removed (even using electron microscopy) revealed no particles at the\nlocations of the bone loss. It that negative finding proof that particles were not the cause\nof the bone loss?\n3. (5%) What alternative explanation (i.e., other than due to particles) would you offer for\nthe loss of bone at X and Y in Fig. 1c?\n4. (10%) How would you propose to alter the design of the prosthesis to address your\nexplanation in (3) for the femoral and tibial components?\nB (15%). Instead of using PMMA for fixation of the femoral component, your company has\ndeveloped a calcium phosphate mineral (hydroxyapatite, HA) coating to enable bone to bond\ndirectly to the prosthesis.\n1. (5%) One of the engineers at the company has suggested that prior to packaging the HA-\ncoated prosthesis it be incubated in a simulated body fluid. This will add to the expense\nof the prosthesis. Can you provide a supporting rationale for such a treatment?\n2. (10%) Clinical trials of the HA-coated prosthesis have provided evidence that large\nportions of the plasma-sprayed HA coating detach from the metal. Removal of a few\nprostheses from which the coating detached has yielded surrounding tissue that contains\nlarge numbers of myofibroblasts and lubricin coatings on the tissue folds. Your CEO has\nproposed that the commercialization of the HA-coated devices continue. What case\nwould you make in support of continuing or discontinuing the commercialization?\n\nC (10%) The company is considering various products to treat the large bone defects in X and Y\nof Fig. 1c when the prosthesis needs to be removed and another implanted.\n1. The CEO has been told that she could use the same HA particles that are employed in the\nplasma-spray coating process (to produce the HA coatings) as a bone graft substitute\nproduct to fill the defects. She was told that the particles (which for this application\nwould be about 1 mm in diameter) are commended by their high strength and density.\nWhat recommendation would you make to the CEO?\n2. Another approach that has been recommended for the treatment of the defects in X and Y\nis to inject a suspension of autologous marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells into the\ndefects. What rationale would you offer for first incorporating the cells into a mass of\nsuitable particles, and the subsequent implantation of the cell-seeded particles?\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nBefore and after drawings of total knee replacement\nDiagram of knee joint implant (artificial knee joint).\nprocedure (by A.D.A.M.)\n\nSee http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/imagepages/9494.htm\nFig. 1 a) Typical total knee replacement prosthesis.\nb) Sketch showing the location of the prosthesis in\nthe knee joint. c) Radiograph of a side view (lateral)\nof a total knee prosthesis that was fixed with\npolymethyl methacrylate (\"bone cement\"), 1 year\npost-implantation.\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.

      "content": "20.441J Fall 2009\nQuiz 3 Sample problem, as solved in class\n\nSynthetic pathways for a new conjunctiva (Yannas).\n\nThe conjunctiva covers the exposed part of the opaque part of the eye (sclera)\nand the inner surface of the eyelids. It is made up three tissue types. The\nepithelial tissue is stratified and contains specialized cells (goblet cells) that\nsynthesize and secrete mucus that contributes to the protective and lubricating\nlayer on the exposed surface of the eye. Underneath the epithelial tissue is a\nvery thin basement membrane and connected to it is the conjunctival stroma, a\nloose vascular supportive tissue comprising extracellular matrix proteins and\nblood vessels. See Fig. 1.\n\nWounds in the conjunctiva can be induced by chronic infection (trachoma)\nthat remains untreated (typically due to unavailability of medical care in certain\ndeveloping economies). Such chronic wounds can be deep, extending into the\nstroma and eventually closing by contraction and scar formation, processes\nwhich block vision. Typically, one eye only is compromised by this condition;\nhowever, both eyes may eventually also get involved..\n\nYou are working as a consultant in a medical device company that is\ninterested in designing a device to be used in inducing regeneration of the\ndiseased conjunctiva. The device that you will design will be placed in contact\nwith a surgically induced full-thickness square wound, initially measuring 2 x 2\nmm2 in area, in the diseased conjunctiva. A successful device will induce\nregeneration of all three tissues of the conjunctiva, with recovery of function in\nless than 8 weeks.\n\nIn your design consideration you will make the assumption that only one\neye has been affected at the time of treatment. Also assume that the conjunctiva\nhas a morphology that is very similar (though not identical) to that of the skin of a\nrodent. You will also assume that the full-thickness conjunctival wound responds\nto regenerative treatment by a successfully selected device as if it were a full-\nthickness wound in the skin of a rodent. Obviously, approximating the\nconjunctival wound with a skin wound is a first-order approximation that only\nserves as a screening tool, of help in selecting a basic design strategy from\namong several strategies that have no chance of providing a useful answer.\n\nListed below are various suggestions for potentially regenerative devices\nthat have been made to you by coworkers or suppliers of medical reagents or\ndevices. For each suggestion, please provide either a positive or negative\nresponse and provide a brief explanation for your selection. A negative response\nimplies that the suggestion has practically no chance of leading to a regenerated\nconjunctiva (little or no efficacy) or that the suggestion comes with an\nunacceptably high cost to the patient (little or no safety). A positive response\ndoes not guarantee success; however, it suggests that the selection has the\npotential of eventually providing a useful device provided other requirements are\nincluded in a future design (high efficacy) and that it is generally safe (high\nsafety).\n\nYour brief response for each selection should address both the efficacy and\nsafety issues.\nPerfect efficacy implies regeneration of all three conjunctival tissue types. If\nunsure about the safety of a substance of device, you must conclude that the\nsafety is not high and must be specifically tested for.\n\nA. An autologous cell culture comprising mature cells from the epithelial\ntissue layer of the conjunctiva from the uninfected eye will be drizzled onto the\nsurgically wounded conjunctiva at the rate of about 2 million cells per day for a\nperiod of 14 days.\n\nB. A porous copolymer of lactic acid/glycolic acid, comonomer ratio 75/25,\nthat degrades with a half-life of 14 days, average pore size 100 μm, with\nrandomly oriented pore channels is grafted on the wound.\n\nC. A porous scaffold identical to that described in B above except seeded\nwith 3 million epithelial conjunctival cells, identical to cells described in A above,\nis grafted on the wound. The cells have been seeded into the scaffold prior to\ngrafting of the scaffold on the wound.\n\nD. Continuous infusion into the wound over 14 days of a low-molecular\nweight substance X that blocks the intracellular pathway responsible for\nsynthesis of alpha smooth muscle actin by fibroblasts. Substance X has been\nstudied in vitro; no in vivo studies of X have been made.\n\nE. A porous collagen/GAG scaffold, degrading with a half-life of 12 days,\naverage pore diameter 100 μm, pore channels randomly oriented. No cells have\nbeen seeded into the scaffold prior to grafting on the wound.\n\nSolutions.\nA. This approach is expected to have no efficacy since epithelial cells by\nthemselves are known not to synthesize the stroma in skin wounds. Its safety\ncan be high by making sure that the autologous epithelial cells are extracted from\nthe surgically removed conjunctival tissues that were procured when the wound\nin the dysfunctional eye was surgically generated. However, the design would\nhave very low safety if it calls for extraction of cells from a biopsy of healthy\nconjunctival tissue from the patient's healthy eye (since it will threaten loss of\nnormal vision in the remaining healthy eye).\nB. The synthetic polymer has no efficacy because it lacks ligands for binding\nintegrins of contractile fibroblasts. Even if there is nonspecific binding on the\nsynthetic polymer surface, absent specific ligands there is little expectation that\ncontraction blocking (a requirement for regeneration) will occur. The safety of the\ndevice is questionable: Even though it will eventually degrade in 2-3 weeks, the\nproduct of degradation of each of the comonomers is a pH-lowering substance\n(e.g., lactic acid) that should cause a local inflammatory response.\n\nC. This system suffers from lack of specific ligands, as in section B above, and\ncannot block contraction. Seeding with epithelial cells may possibly lead to\nsynthesis of an epithelial tissues but the stroma will still be missing because it\nrequires the presence of an active scaffold that can induce changes in the\nphenotype of contractile fibroblasts.\nD. Induced regeneration consists of two steps: wound contraction blocking and\nsynthesis of new stroma. The expected efficacy could be high since the\nsubstance will probably result in contraction blocking, a prerequisite to\nregeneration. However, in the absence of a scaffold that can act as a template\nfor synthesis of new stroma, it is questionable whether new stroma will be\nsynthesized at all. The safety of the substance is unknown and it must therefore\nbe assumed to be low and that it requires testing for toxicity.\nE. This scaffold is DRT, which is known to lead to regeneration of the stroma.\nEpithelial tissue will not be specifically induced to regenerate by use of the\nunseeded scaffold. However, for a small-area wound, as this 2 x 2 mm2 wound is,\nit is expected that epithelial tissue will migrate from the wound edges toward the\nwound center, with synthesis of the epithelial tissue and spontaneous synthesis\nof basement membrane. (This process works well with skin wounds that have\nbeen grafted with a keratinocyre-seeded DRT.) Efficacy should be high. Since all\nthree tissue types will be synthesized. Safety should also be high since this\nscaffold has passed clinical trials in its use as a device that regenerates skin and\nperipheral nerves.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n20.441J / 2.79J / 3.96J / HST.522J Biomaterials-Tissue Interactions\nFall 2009\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

A model of a critical transition from noncooperative to cooperative cell behavior.\nWhat is cooperativity in cell biology? Cells cooperate, i.e., communicate with each other\nand acquire a common phenotype, following formation of condensed states of biological\nmatter. States of this type comprise cells, usually embedded in matrix, that are arranged\nin close proximity with each other and frequently function as a single unit. Examples of\nsuch organized cell structures are contractile cell capsules surrounding tissues in\nwounded organs, columns of Schwann cells, and cords formed by epithelial cells during\nskin synthesis. An example of a cooperative functioning unit is the contractile cell\ncapsule that surrounds skin wounds and nerve wounds during spontaneous healing.\nCooperative activity can be disrupted by scaffolds with specific biological activity,\noccasionally resulting in tissue and organ regeneration.\nHow do cells cooperate? Cells cooperate by sending to and receiving signals from other\ncells that lead to a change in phenotype that eventually leads to similarity in behavior.\nSignals are typically macromolecules, such as growth factors and cytokines of various\ntypes. Cell A sends a signal to a cell B in its vicinity by secreting several macromolecules\nM that travel by diffusion away from cell A, eventually binding on receptors on cell B.\nAfter binding on receptors on cell A these macromolecular signals may modify the\nphenotype of cell B, which now behaves like cell A.\nThe intensity of communication can be described by I, the rate of binding of\nmacromolecular signals on receptors of cell B. The quantity I is the flux rate of signals\ntransferred to B, i.e., the flux rate of signals that were actually received by B. It may not\nbe possible to detect the cell that has sent out the cells but it is always possible, in\nprinciple, to measure the signals that have been received by a cell. The flux rate of signals\nreceived can be measured as the number of macromolecules that have become bound per\nunit surface area of cell B following a defined exposure to cells that emit such\nmacromolecules. Although intensity of communication is required, it does no suffice for\ncooperative behavior since cells must also modify their phenotype, acquiring a common\nphenotype that characterizes the entire assembly of cells.\nCells that do not cooperate at all are referred to as noncooperative (\"isolated\").\nNoncooperative cells show an intrinsic behavior that is not affected by the presence of\nother cells in culture or in a tissue site. An operational definition of an isolated cell is the\nindifference of its behavior to changing levels of cell density in the system. These cells\nhave maintained their original phenotype either because the intensity of communication\nwith neighboring cells was insufficient for conversion to the cooperative phenotype or\nbecause conversion was blocked by a sufficiently high conversion energy.\nCritical transition. The behavior of cooperating cells differs markedly from that of\nisolated cells. When the cell density, or other parameters that are currently under study, a\nkey experimental parameter, is increased above a threshold, cell behavior undergoes a\nsharp change. An example is the mechanical force exerted by cells on matrix. Below the\ndensity threshold cells apply forces that are independent of cell density and are only\ncharacteristic of cell type (and other parameters, such as medium composition). Such\nbehavior is characteristic of point sources of mechanical force that act as if they were\n\n2.79J/3.96J/20.441J/HST552J\nstochastically independent. In contrast, above the threshold, the cells apply their\nindividual forces in unison, developing macroscopic tractions that are significantly higher\nthan they would be if the cells acted independently. In addition, cells above the threshold\napply their forces with a timing that appears to be correlated, i.e., highly dependent on the\nactivity of other cells in the system. The change in behavior above the critical density\nlevel is considered to be an example of an \"all or none\" transition, somewhat similar to\nthe melting of ice to liquid water.\nIn biological terms the transition is described as a change in cell phenotype. In a\ngiven cell, A, such a change may be brought about by receipt of appropriate signals from\nother cells nearby. Signals issued from neighbors become bound on specific receptors on\nA; the bound signal is then transferred into the cytoplasm where it is directed toward the\nnucleus of A along a specific intracellular pathway. Interaction with the genome brings\nabout transcription of genes that modify the behavior of A along a specific direction. If\nthe phenotype of a large number of cells of the same type as A becomes modified along\nthe same direction, the behavior may become cooperative, i.e., the affected cells all show\nthe same new behavior spatially and temporally.\nChange in cell phenotype can be described as an activated process, i.e., one\nrequiring expenditure of a finite amount of energy. Using the terminology of activated\nrate processes, one can represent the transition in terms of an energy change from a state\nof noncooperating cells, Εn , to a state comprising cooperating cells, characterized byΕc ,\nThe transition to cooperative behavior occurs when noncooperative cells cross over an\nactivation \"hump\", Εnc . It follows simply from transition state theory that such a\ntransition is likely to take place frequently when Εnc is low but it becomes nearly\nimpossible to observe when Εnc is forbiddingly high relative to the two lower states on\neither side of the reaction coordinate.\nDerivation of model of a critical transition in cooperative cell behavior. Assume cells\nexist either in \"n\" state (\"noncooperative\"), in which they display the \"n\" phenotype, or\nthey exist in state \"c\" (\"cooperative\") in which they exhibit the \"c\" phenotype. Briefly,\neach phenotype represents a well-defined behavioral state of that cell type. The \"n\"\nphenotype can be described as being characteristic of cells that are isolated from each\nother and may send out but do not receive signals from other cells that might induce a\nphenotype change from \"n\" to \"c\". With isolated cells either there is little or no\ncommunication or else there is intensive communication but the signaling is ineffective in\nbringing about a phenotype change (the model does not inform about either one of these\ncases). In contrast, cells displaying the \"c\" phenotype are close together and receive large\nnumbers of signals from other cells that are effective in changing their phenotype. An\nexample of noncooperating cells are those described by Freyman et al. (Biomaterials\n2001. 22:2883-2891): these cells apply mechanical forces to the extracellular matrix\nindependently of each other and the force applied by a system of cells increases in direct\nproportion to the cell density. An example of cooperating cells is the assembly of\nmyofibroblasts at the edge of a full-thickness skin wound; these cells generate forces that\ninduce the onset of wound contraction and eventually manage to close the wound\n(Yannas, Tissue and Organ Regeneration in Adults, Ch. 9, Springer, 2001).\n\n2.79J/3.96J/20.441J/HST552J\nWe will apply the methodology of statistical mechanics. The goal is to determine\ncertain requirement(s) for observing a critical transition from a noncooperative to a\ncooperative phenotype.\nAssume a configuration A of 7 cells as a mini culture (or mini collection) of\ncooperating (c) and noncooperating cells (n): nccncnn . Assume that these cells occupy a\nunit volume dV. Another mini culture B of 7 cells, occupies another unit volume dV, and\ncan be described as: nncncnn ; a third is described as cncncnn , and so on for mini cultures\nC, D etc. and for a very large number of minicultures.\nThe energy of configuration A will now be represented as the sum of pairwise\ninteractions between nearest-neighbor cells. No other interactions will be assumed to be\npresent. For example, the model excludes consideration of interactions among three or\nmore cells. Cooperative behavior implies collective involvement of a large number of\ncells. The model will answer the question: If only nearest-neighbor interactions (and no\nother more complex interactions) are present, can a critical transition still take place?\nInteractions between cells in configuration A, nccncnn , that may lead to\nphenotype change, will be described by interactions between pairs of cells, so that the\ntotal energy of interaction for configuration A is:\nΕA=Ε +Ε +Ε +Ε +E +Ε\nnc\ncc\ncn\nnc\ncn\nnn\nEach of the several configurations A, B, C, etc. has a certain statistical weight and\nis more or less probable to occur. The statistical weight of each pair-wise interaction is\nrepresented by the appropriate Boltzmann factor of statistical mechanics, i.e., as an\nexponential of the energy of interaction between nearest neighbors. For example,\n(-Εnc / RT ) is the energy of the first interaction shown above. The statistical weight of\nthe entire configuration A is:\nΩA=exp(-ΕA RT ) = exp ⎣⎡(Εnc + Εcc + Εcn + Εnc + Εcn + Enn ) RT ⎦⎤=\nexp(Ε\nRT ).exp E\nRT ).exp E\nRT )....= g .g .g .g .g .g .\nnc\n( cc\n( nc\nnc\ncc\ncn\nnc\ncn\nnn\nThe statistical mechanical partition function (\"sum over all states\") is the sum of\nstatistical factors for all configurations A, B, C etc.:\nΖ = ΩconfA + ΩconfB + ΩconfC +...\n,\nN -1\nΖ = ∑∏gkl;i\nAllΩ j i =1\nwhere kl denote the choice of nn , cn , nc , cc ; i identifies the position (first,\nsecond, etc.) of a cell in the configuration; j is the number of distinguishable\n(different) configurations; and N is the number of cells in a configuration.\nUse matrix algebra representation to decompose this expression.\n\n2.79J/3.96J/20.441J/HST552J\nDefine a 2 x 2 matrix:\n⎡gnn gcn ⎤\nM ≡⎢gc\n⎥\n⎣\ngnn ⎦\nsolve using matrix method (see Appendix A)\nΖ = c1λ1\nN -1 + c2λ2\nN -1\nλ1,λ2 are roots of the matrix while c1,c2 are constants.\nTwo special cases when:\n1.\ngnc <<(gccgnn )2\nΖ ≈c1gcc\nN -1 + c2gnn\nN -1\nIf N is large (many in a configuration), one term dominates Z even if gcc is only\nslightly different than (or even equal to) gnn . This occurs when the transition state\nenergy Enc is sufficiently low compared to the energies of the noncooperative or\nthe cooperative states. An all or none transition is predicted from noncooperative\nto cooperative cell behavior.\ngnc ≈(gccgnn )\n2.\nΖ ≈c1 (gcc + gnn )\nN -1\nHere, the transition state energy Enc is of the same order of magnitude as the\nenergies of the noncooperative and cooperative states. No singularity occurs no\nmatter what the relation of gcc to gnn and no matter what the magnitude of N.\nReturn to randomness.\nThis model shows that nearest-neighbor interactions are sufficient for an \"all or\nnone\" cooperative transition provided that the energy cost of the hybrid state is\nmuch higher than Εnn and Εcc and also provided the sequence is long enough\n(large N).\nThis model describes certain requirements for an all-or-none cooperative\ntransition but does not predict the conditions under which the transition takes\nplace. Such a condition would be, e.g., a critical threshold of the cell density.\n\n2.79J/3.96J/20.441J/HST552J\nNote. A mathematically identical model can be used to describe a helix-coil transition,\ni.e., a thermodynamic melting transformation. Since the system is now described in\nthermodynamic terms it is justified to use statistical thermodynamics arguments (not\npresented here) in order to relate Z to Gibbs' free energy via the relation (see, e.g.,\nT.L.Hill, Introduction to Statistical Thermodynamics):\nG = -RT\n\nln Z + PV\n\n.\nAs explained above, the two cases describe the outcomes. When Case 1 holds the model\npredicts that a critical transition will take place at the helix-coil transition temperature\n(the magnitude of which, however, is not predicted by the model). The important\nprediction from the model is that only nearest-neighbor interactions suffice for the critical\ntransition. When Case 2 holds, the model predicts that a critical transition will not take\nplace. (See Ref. 1 for literature on the helix-coil transition.)\nAppendix A\nUse of Matrix Algebra to Decompose Z (Ref. 2)\nThe roots (eigenvalues) of M are solutions of the secular (polynomial) equation\nλ\nΜ -Ι = 0 , a polynomial of second degree.

It is highly\noriented stroma that is synthesized in the presence\nof the mechanical field that dominates wound\ncontraction.\n- Regeneration requires blocking of contraction. When\ncontraction is blocked by a scaffold, even partly,\nscar formation is cancelled.\n\nWhat is the mechanism of\ncontraction-blocking by an active\nscaffold at the\n- Scale of the cell (1 μm)?\n- Scale of the molecule (1 nm)?\n\nTomasek et al., 2002\nThe contractile fibroblast (myofibroblast.\nMFB) is expressed during wound healing\nand childbirth.

(2002). \"Myofibroblasts and mechano-regulation of\nconnective tissue remodeling. \" Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology 3: 349-363.\n\nNo scaffold.\nContraction.\nDay 10.\nScaffold.\nNo contraction.\nDay 10.\n\nDoes the scaffold act as a mechanical\nsplint?\n- Assume a contractile force Fc = 0.1 N acts on a scaffold\nthat has grafted a wound measuring 10mm X 10mm in\nsurface area with 1 mm depth. Acting on an area A = 10\nmm X 1 mm = 10 mm2 = 10-5 m2, the force applies a\ncompressive stress\nσc = Fc/A = 0.1N/ 10-5 m2 = 104 N/m2 = 104 Pa.\n- At equilibrium the compressive stress applied by the cells\nhypothetically equals the splinting stress, σs , with which\nthe scaffold resists wound contraction.\n- Hypothesize that the scaffold is a relatively stiff splint that\nhas been deformed compressively by no more than 10%,\nor ε = 0.1. It must possess a Young's modulus that is not\nless than E = σs/ε = 104 Pa/0.1 = 105 Pa. However, measured\nvalues of E for scaffolds with pore volume fraction of 0.99\nare only 102Pa. Such scaffolds are 1000X less stiff than\nrequired for mechanical splinting. The hypothesis that the\nscaffold works as a splint is rejected.\n\nModel of wound contraction by\nmyofibroblasts (MFB)\nFc = N fi φ\nFc = Total macroscopic force exerted by MFB, which\nsuffices to close wound by contraction (approx. 0.1 N)\nN = Total number of MFB.\nfi = Contractile force exerted per cell.\nφ = Fraction of MFB which are oriented with their\ncontractile axes in the plane of the wound.\n\nIn the absence of the scaffold, the macroscopic force that\ncontracts wound cannot be easily explained by hypothesizing\nindependent (noncooperative) cell contractile activity.\n- Measured macroscopic force is about 33 times higher!!\n-Do cells generate larger force by acting cooperatively?\nMacroscopic\nContraction force\nNo. cells\nForce per cell\nOrientation factor\n-If myofibroblasts act independently and are oriented in the\nplane, the macroscopic force is:\nFc = N fi\nφ\nFc = 3 x 105 cells x 10 nN/cell x 1 = 3 x 10-3 N\n0.1 N >> 3 x 10-3 N\n\nMechanism of scaffold activity # 1.\nScaffold reduces the number of\ncontractile cells\n- Fact: In absence of scaffold, 50 % of fibroblasts in wound\nare MFB. In presence of scaffold only 10% are MFB.\n- The structure of collagen fibers in active scaffolds has\nbeen modified by acid treatment to reduce significantly the\n% banded collagen fibers.\n- Loss of banding blocks thrombogenicity (platelet\naggregation) of collagen fibers which in turn leads to\nTGFb1 depletion in wound.\n- TGFb1 depletion prevents MFB differentiation.\n- Fc = Nφfi. . According to this mechanism, the number of\nMFB, N, goes down in the presence of the scaffold. The\nmacroscopic contractile force, Fc, is correspondingly\nreduced.\n\nMechanism of scaffold activity # 2.\nScaffold disorients MFB thereby\nreducing sum of forces generated by\nMFB\n- Fact: MFB bind avidly on scaffold surface with their\nlong (contractile) axes quasi randomly oriented in\nspace. Only a small fraction are oriented in the plane.\n- Fact: Bound MFB lose many connections with\nneighboring cells.\n- Lacking orientation in the plane of the wound, MFB\nlose most of their ability to pull wound edges in the\nplane and close the wound by contraction.\n- Fc = Nφfi. According to this mechanism, the fraction of\ncells, φ, bound to the matrix and capable of applying\ntraction, is reduced following grafting with an active\nscaffold. The macroscopic contractile force, Fc, is\ncorrespondingly reduced.\n\nHypothesis of loss of cell-cell\ncooperativity\n- In the absence of an active scaffold, MFB\nare connected and oriented. They function\ncooperatively during wound contraction.\nThe sum of forces exerted is higher than\nthe sum of forces exerted by individual\ncells acting independently\n(noncooperatively).\n- An active scaffold separates and\ndisorients the MFB. It causes loss of cell-\ncell cooperativity.\n\nTwo examples of clinical\napplication\nof the dermis regeneration\ntemplate, DRT\n\nBilayer medical device approved by FDA\nIn clinical applications where skin is severely injured\nthe active scaffold is used as a bilayer.

What is the best current mechanism\nof induced organ regeneration in adults using\nactive scaffolds at the cell-biological and the\nmolecular-biological levels?\n1. Strong blocking of wound contraction, which\nleads to cancellation of scar formation.\n2. Contraction blocking follows reduction of\ndensity of contractile cells and disorientation of\ntheir contractile axes.\n3. Phenotype changes hypothetically due to\nregulation following binding of contractile cells\non specific ligands of insoluble surface of\nscaffold.\n\nQuestion 2: Is the process of induced\nregeneration of organ in adults similar to\nspontaneous regeneration at the early fetal\nstage?\nPartly, yes. Common features include:\nDownregulation of: wound contraction, density\nand function of contractile cells, cytokine (TGFβ-\n1) credited with induction of phenotype of\ncontractile cells. However, myofibroblasts\npresent in adult but not in early fetal wounds.\nRole of TGFβ-2 unclear.

After severe injury, and in contrast to the fetus, the\nadult heals most organs irreversibly (no regeneration).\n2. Most organs are made up of three basic tissues\n(\"tissue triad\"): epithelia, basement membrane, and\nstroma.\n3. Epithelia and basement membrane are spontaneously\nregenerative; the stroma is not.\n4. Therefore, the central problem in biomaterials selection\nfor organ replacement by regeneration is synthesis of\nthe stroma.\nText: Chaps. 1 and 2 of Tissue and Organ Regeneration in\nAdults, by I.V.Yannas, New York, Springer, 2001 (on\nreserve in MIT Libraries).\n\nThe healed liver has the\nsame mass, but a different\nshape (resected lobes are\nnot regenerated), than the\nintact organ\nFigure removed due to copyright restrictions.\nSee Figure 1.2 in [TORA].\n\nscarred heart muscle\n(heart attack)\nscarred liver\n(cirrhosis)\nscarred cornea\n(infection)\nscarred kidney\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\nSee Figure 1.3 in [TORA].\n(infection)\nscarred heart valve\n(rheumatic fever)\nPathology resulting from irreversibility of injury in various organs\n\nThe tissue triad in organs\n- epithelial tissue: 100% cellular, no\nECM\n- basement membrane: 100% ECM , no\ncells\n- stroma: cells, ECM, blood vessels\n\nOrgans are made of tissues which heal\ndifferently from each other.

Gardner Lab, Scripps Institute (2003)\n\nINTEGRINS\n(from http://life.kjist.ac.kr/)\nIntegrins are membrane-bound molecules (receptors) that can bind to\nextracellular matrix molecules (\"adhesion proteins\" and collagen). They are\nthe principal mechanism by which cells both bind to and respond to the\nextracellular matrix. They are part of a large family of cell adhesion\nmolecules which are involved in cell-extracellular matrix and cell-cell\ninteractions. Functional integrins consist of two transmembrane glycoprotein\nsubunits that are non-covalently bound. Those subunits are called alpha and\nbeta. The alpha subunits all have some homology to each other, as do the beta\nsubunits. The receptors always contain one alpha chain and one beta chain\nand are thus called heterodimeric. Both of the subunits contribute to the\nbinding of ligand. Until now 16 alpha and 8 beta subunits have been\nidentified. From these subunits some 22 integrins are formed in nature, which\nimplicates that not all possible combinations exist. The beta-4 subunit for\ninstance can only form a heterodimer with the alpha-6 subunit. On the other\nhand the beta-1 subunit can form heterodimers with ten different alpha\nsubunits. Because not all the beta-1 alpha heterodimers have the same ligand\nspecificities, it is believed that the alpha chain is at least partly involved in the\nligand specificity.\n\nIntegrins differ from other cell-surface receptors in that they bind their\nligands with a low affinity (106-109 liters/mole) and that they are usually\npresent at 10-100 fold higher concentration on the cell surface. The\nintegrins however can only bind their ligands when they exceed a certain\nminimal number of integrins at certain places, called focal contacts and\nhemidesmosomes. So when the integrins are diffusely distributed over\nthe cell surface, no adhesion will be present, but when after a certain\nstimuli these integrins cluster for example in focal contacts their\ncombined weak affinities give rise to a spot on the cell surface which has\nenough adhesive (sticking) capacity to adhere to the extracellular\nmatrix. This is a very useful situation, because in this way cells can bind\nsimultaneously but weakly to large numbers of matrix molecules and\nstill have the opportunity to explore their environment without losing all\nattachment to it by building or breaking down focal contacts. If the\nreceptors were to bind strongly to their ligands, cells would probably be\nirreversibly bound to the matrix, depriving them from motility. This\nproblem does not arise when attachment depends on multiple weak\nadhesions.\nINTEGRINS\n(from http://life.kjist.ac.kr/)\n\nINTEGRINS\n(from http://life.kjist.ac.kr/)\nIntegrins can bind to an array of ligands. Common ligands are\nfibronectin and laminin, which are both part of the CT\nextracellular matrix and basal lamina. Both of these ligands\nmentioned above are recognized by multiple integrins. For\nadhesion to ligands both integrin subunits are needed, as is the\npresence of cations. The alpha chain has cation binding sites.\nIntegrins are composed of long extracellular domains which\nadhere to their ligands, and short cytoplasmic domains that\nlink the receptors to the cytoskeleton of the cell.\nThe structure of alpha subunits is very similar. All contain 7\nhomologous repeats of 30-40 amino acids in their extracellular\ndomain, spaced by stretches of 20-30 amino acids. The three or\nfour repeats that are most extracellular, contain sequences\nwith cation-binding properties. These sequences are thought to\nbe involved in the binding of ligands, because the interaction of\nintegrins with their ligand is cation-dependent.\n\nIntegrin Signaling, FG Giancotti, E Ruoslahti, Sci., 285:1028 (1999)\nFigure 1. \"Cell survival and cell proliferation require interaction with the extracellular\nmatrix...\"\nImage removed due to copyright restrictions.\n\nFigure 4. \"Major signaling pathways\nthat are known or presumed to be\ncoordinately regulated by integrins\nand growth factors receptors...\"\nIntegrin Signaling, FG Giancotti,\nE Ruoslahti, Sci., 285:1028 (1999)\nImage removed due to\ncopyright restrictions.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n20.441J / 2.79J / 3.96J / HST.522J Biomaterials-Tissue Interactions\nFall 2009\n\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

One atom is more electronegative than the others.\n1) Can become ionized and interact by ionic forces (10-20 kcal/mol.). Like ionic charges repel.\n2) Form permanent dipoles and interact by:\na. Hydrogen bonding (approx. 3-7 kcal/mol)\nb. Molecular orientation\nc. Induction interactions\n3) Intensity of dipole/dipole interactions are dependent on distance of separation and orientation\nof individual dipoles. Parallel dipoles can repel each other.\n4) Polar/ionic groups can have acidic (proton donating or electron accepting) or base (proton\naccepting, or OH or electron donating) character. Acid-base interactions are likely as\nopposed to acid-acid or base-base which are repulsive.\n5) Biomaterials with ionic groups or strong dipoles on the solid surface will tend to bind water\nmolecules (hydrophilic).\n6) The presence of specific polar groups is inferred from determination of elements, molecules,\nand bonding in the surface of biomaterials.\n10.1.2\nNonpolar (Apolar) Molecules\nNonpolar molecules might be available to undergo van der Waals interactions (nonspecific)\nwith biological molecules. The \"bond energy\" of approximately 1-2 kcal/mol. is due to the\ncorrelation of the electronic motion of the molecules.\n10.1.3\nSurface Free Energy (Critical Surface Tension)\n1) An atom in the free surface has no neighbors on one side. Since bond energies are negative\nits energy is higher than interior atoms by the missing share of bond energy.\n2) Chemical bonds of surface atoms are asymmetrically directed toward the interior of the\nmaterial, attracting the surface atoms inward and causing surface tension.\n3) Energy required to create a free surface (e.g., by fracture of the material) is reflected in the\nsurface energy. Thermodynamic forces act to minimize surface energy.\na. Low energy molecules near the surface are translated and rotated toward the surface.\nLow energy components in the bulk migrate (diffuse) to the surface.\nThese include:\n1. Low molecular weight additives (e.g., antioxidants, processing aids, etc.) or\ndegradation products\n2. Contaminants\nb. Exposed surface groups attempt to lower their energy (i.e., unsatisfied bonding) by\nadsorbing or reacting with ambient molecules.\n1. Adsorption of hydrocarbon (contamination) by all materials\n\n2. Oxide formation on metals\n4) Surfaces with low critical surface tension are hydrophobic. Hydrophobic surfaces interrupt\nthe hydrogen bonded structure of water (i.e., force water molecules to structure in an ice-like\nconformation on or near the surface). Water droplets do not spread on hydrophobic\nsurfaces.\n5) \"Bond energy\" of hydrophobic interactions (dispersion force) is approx. 1-2 kcal/mol.\n6) Critical surface tension of solids can be determined from contact angle measurements and the\nZisman plot.\n\n10.2 SURFACE CHEMISTRY RELATED TO BONDING OF BIOLOGICAL\nMOLECULES\n10.2.1\nMolecules\n10.2.1.1 Type (with respect to polarity)\n1) Magnitude of the dipole moment. Molecules with no dipole moment are nonpolar\nand thus provide a very hydrophobic surface (e.g., PTFE).\n2) Potential to become ionized to form ionic bond.\n10.2.1.2 Distribution\nCould affect chemical specificity by providing a certain template of bonds.\n10.2.1.3 Density\nFor example, hydrogels have a very low density of molecules at the surface to\naccommodate a considerable amount of water.\n10.2.1.4 Mobility\nSurface of certain polymers (e.g., polyurethanes) are dynamic (i.e., always changing\nbecause of mobility of the molecules).\n10.2.2\nSurface Characteristics Resulting from Chemistry\n10.2.2.1 Hydrophobicity\n10.2.2.2 Charge\n\n10.3 POROSITY (Pore characteristics and what features that they affect)\nVoid Fraction; Percentage Porosity\nStrength of the material\nAmount of tissue that can form in the material\nSurface area\nPore Diameter; Interconnecting Pore Diameter\nSurface area\nSize of the tissue elements (e.g., cells) that can infiltrate the material\nPore Orientation\nDirection of cell migration and architecture of the tissue that forms\n\n10.4 FACTORS AFFECTING THE BIOMATERIAL SURFACE\n1)\nExposure to air (e.g., hydrocarbon contaminants).\n2)\nHandling (e.g., contamination with particles and alteration of topography).\n3)\nStorage time (e.g., residual stresses can result in dimensional changes).\n4)\nSterilization\na. Autoclave (steam)\nEffects of temperature and absorbed water in altering mechanical properties of certain\nthermoplastics.\nb. Dry heat (prolonged high temperatures)\nc. Gas (ethylene oxide)\nProlonged period of aeration required for certain polymers.\nd.

The wavelength of radiation needs to be on the order of (or less than) the\nspacing to be detected.\nBragg's Law\nn l = 2d sin q\nn = integer indicating which multiple of the diffracted wave is being considered\nl = wavelength of radiation\nd = spacing between features in the structure (e.g., spacing between molecules in a\ncrystal)\nq = the angle between incident and diffracted waves.\nd=\nn l\n2 sin q\nType of\nDiffraction\nRadiation\nl\nOptical\nLaser light\n400 nm\nX- ray\nX-ray\n0.154 nm\n(for copper)\nElectron\ne-\n0.005 nm\nat 50 kV\nDepth analyzed for x-ray diffraction (i.e., depth of penetration of the x-ray beam) is 1-10 mm.\n\n11.5 CONTACT ANGLE\n11.5.1 Method\nq (included angle) = 0: complete wetting\n0<q<90°: partial wetting\nq>90°: nonwetting\nAt Equilibrium, ? surface tensions = 0\ngSG-gLS-gGL cos q = 0\ngSG-gSL = gLG cos q\nYoung's equation\nCannot solve for gSG because\nin equation gSG = gSL + gLG cos q\nThere are 2 unknowns, gSL and gSG\nThe experimental method employed to approximate gSG involves asking the question: what is\nthe surface tension of a liquid that would completely wet the solid surface? This value is referred to as\nthe critical surface tension of the solid.\n11.5.2 Assumptions\nEquilibrium between the liquid droplet and solid surface has been reached (i.e., no absorption of\nliquid by the solid and no leaking of substances from the solid). If this assumption cannot be\nmet then the \"advancing angle\" can be measured to determine the contact angle of the liquid with\nthe dry surface and \"receding angle\" measured to determine the contact angle with the water\nabsorbed surface.\nAn alternative method is to measure the underwater (captive-air-bubble) contact angle that an\nair bubble makes with the immersed surface. This is particularly valuable for measuring surface\nthat can switch from hydrophobic to hydrophilic depending on the environment.\n11.5.3 Potential Problems\n1) Contamination of the solid surface\n2) Contamination of liquids\n\n11.6 SPECTROSCOPY\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n20.441J / 2.79J / 3.96J / HST.522J Biomaterials-Tissue Interactions\nFall 2009\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

All cells arise from the division of pre-existing cells. The process of\nmitosis is divided into four phases: a) prophases-formation of paired chromosomes;\ndisappearance of nuclear membrane, b) metaphase-chromosomes separate into exactly similar\nhalves, c) anaphase-the two groups of daughter chromosomes separate and move along the\nfibers of a central \"spindle\", and d) telophase-the daughter chromosomes resolve themselves\ninto a \"reticulum\" and the daughter nuclei are formed; the cytoplasm divides, forming two\ncomplete daughter cells.\nThe term mitosis is used interchangeably with cell division, but strictly speaking it refers to\nnuclear division whereas cytokinesis refers to division of the cytoplasms.\n2.4.1.2 Synthesis (e.g., ECM structural proteins, enzymes)\nSynthesis refers to the putting together of a chemical compound by the cell through the\nunion of the elements comprising the compound or from other suitable starting materials. The\nchemical compounds can be proteins that serve as structural elements (e.g., collagen), enzymes\n(e.g., collagenase), regulators of other cells (e.g., hormones), immunoglobulins, etc. The\ncompounds can be carbohydrates, lipids, or other macromolecules required in cell, tissue, or\norgan function. The products of cell synthesis can be stored in the cytoplasm or excreted by the\ncell.\n2.4.1.3 Exocytosis (including degranulation)\nExocytosis refers to the process by which a cell excretes particles that are too large to\ndiffuse through the cell membrane. It is considered to be the opposite of endocytosis.\n2.4.1.4 Endocytosis\nEndocytosis refers to the uptake by a cell of material too large to difuse through its\nmembrane. In the process of ingesting the material the cell invaginates its membrane, collecting\nthe material in the fold produced by the invagination. Particles of the material larger than\napproximately one micrometer are \"phagocytosed.\" In this process the cell membrane binds to\nthe particle through a membrane receptor. Particles less than one micrometer are collected in\nthe folds of the invaginated membrane with or without receptor binding, referred to as receptor-\nmediated endocytosis and pinocytosis , respectively. Fluid is taken up by the cell through the\nprocess of pinocytosis.\n2.4.1.5 Migration\n\nMigration refers to the movement of cells as a result of the action of intracellular\ncytoskeletal and contractile proteins and the receptor-mediated adhesion of the cell to\nextracellular matrix components (by integrins).\n2.4.1.6 Contraction\nAt the cell level, contraction refers to the shortening of a cell and the concomitant\ndevelopment of tension in the matrix, as a result of the action of intracellular contractile proteins.\nThe contractile proteins facilitating cell contraction are of the same family as facilitate cell\nmigration.\n2.4.2 Cell Protagonists\nRequires a specific differentiated cell protagonist (Table 2.1). The process begins when the cell\nbecomes the protagonist when expresses a specific phenotype or engages in a specific activity.\n2.4.3 Chronology\nCan appear at different sites at different times in different physiological and pathological\nsequences (i.e., modular; Table 2.2).\n2.4.4 Matrix\nRequires an insoluble matrix component/substrate (Table 2.3) for the cell activity. Cell acts on a\nsubstrate (e.g., extracellular matrix) through a membrane receptor (e.g., integrin) and a series of\nstereospecific biochemical reactions initiated by a signal (i.e., soluble regulator; see sec. 2.4.8). The\nmatrix can serve as an insoluble regulator of cell function/activity.\n2.4.5 Products\nResults in a product that is a stable insoluble structure, soluble fragment, and/or mechanical\nforce (Table 2.4). The quality of the product is invariant but the quantity is not; the product is\nquantifiable with respect to amount and direction/orientation, thus making the product a vector quantity.\n2.4.5.1 Macromolecular Aggregates (Macromolecule) or Soluble Fragments\nAn example is collagen. The structure of a macromolecule is its conformation. In this\ncase only one cell type is required (e.g., fibroblast) in the unit cell processes of synthesis and\ndegradation.\n2.4.5.2 Acellular Multicomponent Structure (Matrix)\nExamples are basement membrane and clot. The structure comprises two or more types\nof macromolecules and may include nonviable cells. The structure of a matrix is its architecture.\n2.4.5.3 Tissue (Cell + Matrix)\nA system of multicomponent structures with viable cells. The structure of a tissue is its\nmorphology.\n2.4.6 Examples\nExamples of unit cell processes are given in Tables 2.5 and 2.6.\n\n2.4.7 Composite Processes\nTwo or more unit processes can combine to form a composite process (Table 2.7).\n2.4.8 Regulators\nUnit cell processes are regulated by diffusible soluble substances (Tables 2.8 - 2.11) acting on\nthe cell protagonist directly or by mechanical forces acting on the cell indirectly through the matrix (e.g.,\nby deforming the matrix). The regulators signal the start and the termination of the process. They also\nserve as connecting links between processes that comprise a composite process (e.g., the \"coupling\nfactor\" between bone resorption and bone formation). In addition, regulators can control the rate of the\nprocess by acting on the cell and the substrate.\n2.4.8 Rates of Processes\nIf the time period over which the unit cell process acts is t, then the rate of the process could be\nconsidered to be the quantity of product divided by t.\n\n2.4 UNIT CELL PROCESSES\nTABLE 2.1\nCell Protagonists\nCells of the same kind associate to form tissues. Tissues are divided into four types: connective\ntissue, epithelia, muscle, and nerve. Organs are formed by the combination of two or more tissues.\nA.

They act on a target cell\nby binding to specific high-affinity receptors . Cytokines that act on the same cell that produced them\nare called autocrine factors; those that act on other cells are called paracrine factors; those that act\nsystemically (through the vascular system) are referred to as endocrine factors. Molecules that switch\non (i.e., regulate) mitosis are referred to as growth factors.\n\n** Eicosanoids are chemically related signaling lipid molecules made primarily from arachidonic acid\n(fatty acid). Eicosanoids include prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, and lipoxins.\nProstaglandins are continuously synthesized in membranes from precursors (20-carbon fatty acid chains\nthat contain at least 3 double bonds, e.g., arachidonic acid) cleaved from membrane phospholipids by\nphospholipases, membrane-bound enzymes. They are continuously released by the cell, and are\ndegraded by enzymes in the extracellular fluids. The subscript of PGE2 refers to the 2 double bonds\noutside the ring structure.\n\n2.4 UNIT CELL PROCESSES\nTABLE 2.9\nCertain Cytokines (Growth Factors) as Regulators of Cell Activities*\nMigration\nMitosis\n(Chemotaxis)\nSynthesis, FB\nCytokine\nFB** EN\nFB EN MC\nCollagen Collagenase\nPlatelet Derived\n+\n+\n+\n+\n+\nGrowth Factor (GF)\n(PDGF)\nFibroblast GF (FGF)\n+\n+\n+\n+\n?\n?\n+\nTransforming GF-b\n-/+\n-\n+\n?\n+\n+\n+\n(TGF-b)\nTransforming GF-a\n+\n+\n+\n?\n?\n+\nand Epidermal GF (EGF)\nInterleukin-1 (IL-1)\n+\n0/-\n?\n?\n+\n+\n+\nand Tumor Necrosis\nFactor (TNF)\n+ -\nStimulates\n-\n-\nInhibits\n0 -\nNo effect\n* Adapted from R.

It\nis characterized in the acute form by the classical signs of pain (dolor), heat (calor), redness\n(rubor), swelling (tumor), and loss of function (functiolaesa). It is caused by injurious agents:\nbiological agents (bacteria), physical agents (heat and mechanical trauma), chemical agents\n(small toxic molecules and immunogenic macromolecules).

Chronic Inflammation\n5.3.2.1 Acute Inflammation\nComprises cellular processes, soluble mediators, and vascular changes occurring\nimmediately following injury to vascular tissue and is of relatively short duration (from a\nfew minutes to a few days). The classical clinical signs are: heat, redness, swelling, and\npain. In many cases function of the tissue is compromised.\n5.3.2.2 Chronic Inflammation\nCell types and activities associated with a persistent injury or permanent implant,\nthat could continue for months or years.\n5.3.2.2.1 Synovium\nThe chronic inflammatory tissue bordering an implant often has the cell\ncomposition (macrophages and fibroblasts) and arrangement (cells in mono- or\nmultiple-layer) consistent with synovium, The tissue that lines joints and\nencapsulates fluid-filled sacs (bursae).\n5.3.2.2.2 Granuloma\nA focal accumulation of epithelioid cells (macrophages altered in\nappearance to resemble epithelial cells) and multinucleated giant cells.
