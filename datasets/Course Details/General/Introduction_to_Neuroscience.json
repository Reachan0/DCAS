We then move to the sensory systems such as olfaction, hearing, and vision and discuss how physical energy such as light is converted into neural signals, where these signals travel in the brain, and how they are processed. Next we study the control of voluntary movement. Finally, we cover the neurochemical bases of brain diseases and those systems which control motivation, emotion, learning and memory.\n\nTextbook\n\nBear, Mark F., Barry W. Connors, and Michael A.

To\nconstruct the model, they performed experiments to determine how the conductances gNa\nand gK depended on activation and inactivation variables, and in turn how these variables\ndepended on voltage. These experiments were summarized in a set of differential\nequations which made up the model. Because the equations are fairly complex, they will\nnot be described here. You can learn about them if you take the class 9.29 Introduction to\nComputational Neuroscience.\n\nIn 9.01, we will use the computer program HHsim to simulate a variant of the Hodgkin-\nHuxley model. This is a helpful exercise because we can use HHsim to perform\nsimulated experiments on neurons. This is helpful for developing intuition about the\nbehaviors of real neurons, but is a lot easier than doing real experiments.\n\nThe simulation program HHsim, which was developed at CMU by David Touretzky and\nhis collaborators, is available at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/HHsim/. Here\nis how to obtain and install it.\nMicrosoft Windows or Linux\nIf you use Microsoft Windows, you can download a standalone version of HHsim. This\nshould create an application that you can double click to run.\nMacintosh or MIT Server\n\nIf you use Mac OS X, or do not own a personal computer, you should run HHsim within\nthe MATLAB environment. (Although there is a standalone version for Mac available for\ndownload, it is an outdated release.) MATLAB is also an option for Windows and Linux\nusers.\n\nIf you do not already have MATLAB installed, you should download it from\nhttp://web.mit.edu/matlab/www/ Hopefully you will be able to install and\nrun with no problems. If all else fails, or you do not own a computer, you can run\nMATLAB on an MIT Server.\n\nAssuming that you have MATLAB working, download the MATLAB source code for\nHHsim from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/HHsim/. When you unzip the file,\nthere will be a directory called hhsim on your disk.\n\nAt the MATLAB command prompt, type the command cd hhsim to change to that\ndirectory. Then type hhsim to start the simulation program. A graphical user interface\n(GUI) window should come up on your screen, and you will be able to interact with it\nusing buttons, text boxes, sliders, and so on."

Many of the\nexercises will make use of a computer program called HHsim, which is described in an\naccompanying handout. While collaboration is allowed, you are required to write up your\nsolutions independently, as well as document the names of your collaborators. In your\nanswers, please try to address all major points yet also be concise.\n1. The Nernst potential\nSuppose that astronauts discover life on Mars. They excitedly bring it into the lab on\nboard their spaceship, and measure the following ionic concentrations (in mM).\n\nintracellular\nextracellular\nLi+\nBr-\nMg2+\n0.001\nThe membranes of Martian cells are permeable to lithium, but not to bromide and\nmagnesium.\nQuestion A (6 pts): What are the Nernst potentials of the three types of ions, calculated\nat body temperature 37°C? Give the value of the intracellular potential with the\nconvention that the potential of the extracellular space is zero. Make sure to get the sign\nright, as it's even more important than the exact number!\nQuestion B (3 pts): How do the Nernst potentials change if a typical Martian temperature\nof 10°C is used instead? Just indicate the direction of the change for each ion (no need to\ncalculate exact numbers).\n2. Activation and inactivation of the voltage-gated sodium channel\nOne of the most confusing aspects of the action potential is the presence of distinct\n\"activation\" and \"inactivation\" processes, which are both voltage-dependent, and both\naffect the conductance of the sodium channel. Activation and inactivation have opposite\neffects on the sodium conductance, and hence on voltage. However, inactivation is not the\nabsence of activation! They are actually two independent processes. Indeed, it is possible\nfor the sodium channel to be activated and inactivated at the same time.\nIn HHsim, activation and inactivation variables are plotted in the bottom graph of the\nmain window. The m variable quantifies the amount of \"activation\" and the h variable\n\nquantifies the amount of \"inactivation.\" Both variables take on values between 0 and 1.\nHere is how the words correspond to the numbers:\n\nm\ndeactivated\nactivated\nh\ninactivated\ndeinactivated\n\nQuestion A (4pts): For sodium current to flow, the sodium channel must be __________\n(activated/deactivated), and ___________ (inactivated/deinactivated). In other words, m\nshould not be ___ (0/1) and h should not be ____ (0/1).\n\nQuestion B (4pts): What effect does depolarization (a shift in the membrane voltage to a\nless negative value) have on activation and inactivation? What is the effect in terms of m\nand h?\n\nThe variables m and h are plotted as functions of time in yellow and green traces of the\nbottom graph of the HHsim main window. The simulator starts out with the neuron at its\nresting potential. Click on the yellow or green trace to display its value in the lower right\nhand corner.\n\nQuestion C (4pts): What is the value of m at rest? Does that mean the sodium channels\nare activated or deactivated? What is the value of h at rest? Does that mean the sodium\nchannels are inactivated or deinactivated?\n3. Activation of the voltage-gated potassium channel\nThe potassium channel is simpler than the sodium channel, because it lacks inactivation.\nThere is just a single activation variable n, taking on values between 0 (deactivated) and 1\n(activated). The sodium current is said to be transient, because depolarization can only\nmake it flow temporarily, before inactivation shuts it down. The potassium current is said\nto be persistent, because depolarization can make it flow indefinitely.\n\nQuestion A (2pts): For potassium current to flow, the potassium channel must be\n_________ (activated/deactivated). In other words, n should not be ___ (0/1).\nQuestion B (2pts): What effect does depolarization (a shift in the membrane voltage to a\nless negative value) have on activation? What is the effect in terms of n?\n\nThe variable n is plotted as a function of time in the cyan trace of the bottom graph of the\nHHsim main window. The simulator starts out with the neuron at its resting potential.\nClick on the cyan trace to display the value of n.\n\nQuestion C (2pts): What is the value of n at rest? Does that mean the potassium channels\nare activated or deactivated?\n\n4. Action potential\nClick on the purple Stim1 button at the bottom left of the main window. The button\nsimulates the effect of injecting a current pulse into the cell through a microelectrode. In\nthe upper graph of the main window, the stimulus current is plotted as a purplish line,\nwhile the membrane voltage is plotted as a red line. The stimulus current is positive, and\nis said to be depolarizing. You should see an action potential, or \"spike\" in the membrane\nvoltage.\n\nQuestion A (4pts): Based on observation of your simulation, make a drawing of what\nhappens to the membrane voltage, m, h, and n. Two of the variables change more rapidly,\nand two of them change more slowly. Which are which?\n\nQuestion B (8pts): Explain why it's important for the slow variables to be slow, in the\ngeneration of an action potential.\n\nNow click on the Stim2 button to apply a negative, or hyperpolarizing current pulse to\nthe cell. Notice that this also results in a spike. This behavior may be a bit surprising at\nfirst. To understand it, you'll have to think about the voltage-dependence of the channels.\n\nQuestion C (8pts): Explain why a negative current pulse is able to cause an action\npotential.\n\n5. Repolarization\n\nPress the Channels button at the top of the main window. A Channels window will pop\nup. Press on the Delayed Rectifier (potassium) button. The button will change from\ncolored to gray, meaning that the channel is disabled. Now press the yellow Nudge button\nat the bottom of the main window (you could also press the Run button if you like).\n\nQuestion A (6pts): The membrane voltage jumps up rapidly, performing the upstroke of\nthe action potential. Explain why this happens.\nQuestion B (4pts): After the upstroke of the action potential, the membrane voltage does\nnot repolarize, instead settling at a positive value. What is that value? (Click on the red\ntrace to find out.) Explain why the membrane voltage does not repolarize.\n\nIf you would like to reenable the channel after you are done with this exercise, press on\nthe Delayed Rectifier button again. The button will change from gray back to colored."

The center-surround interpretation of Chevreul's illusion. Chevreul's illusion\nconsists of vertical stripes of varying luminance. Although the luminance is actually\nconstant within each stripe, the borders of each stripe are perceived to be different in\nlightness than its interior.\nThis image can be represented by a set of numbers, where each number is the amount of\nlight coming from the corresponding location in the image.\n⋱\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n⋰\n⋯\n⋯\n⋯\n⋯\n⋯\n⋯\n⋯\n⋯\n⋰\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n⋱\nThe 0's corresponds to the black stripe, the 1's to the slightly lighter stripe next to it, and\nso on. The ellipses indicate that the same numbers continue at the borders.\nIn class we modeled a center-surround receptive field as a set of numbers like this.\n-1/8 -1/8 -1/8\n-1/8\n-1/8\n-1/8 -1/8 -1/8\nAccording to this model, a center-surround cell computes a weighted sum of nine image\npixels, where the weights are given in the 3×3 box. For these particular numerical values,\nthe center-surround cell computes the difference between the central image pixel and the\naverage of the eight surrounding pixels. This is an ON-center cell, since the central\nnumber is positive.\na) Now imagine an array of these center-surround cells, one at each location in the above\nimage. What would the output of these cells be? Fill in the blanks below.\n⋱\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n⋰\n⋯\n⋯\n⋯\n⋯\n⋯\n⋯\n⋯\n⋯\n⋰\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n⋱\nb) The filled-in table is a model of the retinal response to Chevreul's illusion (or at least\nthe response of the ON-center cells). How is this model different from your own\nsubjective perception of lightness in Chevreul's illusion?\nc) How would you change the numbers in the receptive field model to improve the match\nbetween the model response and your perceived lightness? Explain your answer.\n\n3. Neural coding of color. From the physics perspective, color space is infinite-\ndimensional, as a complete description of the frequency content of light requires one\nnumber for every frequency. But from the psychological perspective, color space is three-\ndimensional, because our color perceptions are based on the signals from three types of\ncones. That's why essentially all colors can be generated by mixing just three primary\ncolors.\nred + blue = magenta\nred + green = yellow\ngreen + blue = cyan\nred+green+blue =white\nFor example, the above diagram shows how secondary colors can be generated by mixing\npairs of primary colors. Let's try to understand this mixing phenomenon in terms of the\nresponses of cone photoreceptors. The normalized responses of the cones to\nmonochromatic light are shown in this graph (ignore the dotted line, which is for rods).\nBy reading values from the graph, fill in the following table with numbers. Don't worry\nabout being exact; just give approximate numbers.\nS\nM\nL\nviolet\nblue\ncyan\ngreen\nyellow\nred\nEach row contains the cone responses when the retina is stimulated with monochromatic\nlight of a particular frequency/wavelength. The three numbers in each row could be\nregarded as the \"neural code\" for that color. The graph can also be used to predict the\n\ncone responses when the retina is stimulated with a 50-50 mixture of two monochromatic\nlights. The response to the mixture is just the average of the responses to the\nmonochromatic stimuli.\na) Compute the average of the blue and green rows. Your answer should be a set of three\nnumbers (a 3d vector) representing the cone responses when exposed to a mixture of blue\nlight and green light. These numbers should be similar to those in the cyan row. This is\nwhy a mixture of blue and green light looks the same to our brains as a monochromatic\ncyan light, even though these two stimuli are physically different.\nb) Compute the average of the green and red rows. While this average is somewhat\nsimilar to the numbers in the yellow row, the match is not as good as it was in part (a).\nThink about why the brain still perceives yellow when stimulated with a mixture of green\nand red (but don't write your thoughts in the homework).\nc) Compute the average of the blue and red rows. This is the neural code for the color\nmagenta. Note that the table only includes colors from the rainbow, those that can be\nproduced by monochromatic light. To what rainbow color is magenta most similar\n(where similarity is measured based on their neural codes)? How is magenta different\nfrom this color?"

While collaboration is allowed, you are required to write up your solutions\nindependently, as well as document the names of your collaborators. In your answers, please try\nto address all major points yet also be concise.\n1. The McCulloch-Pitts model neuron. Previously we learned how action potentials and\nsynaptic potentials are caused by the dynamics of ionic conductances. Such dynamics were\nmodeled mathematically by Hodgkin and Huxley in their Nobel-winning 1952 paper. But much\nsimpler models of neurons have also proved useful for studying the computational capabilities of\nneural networks. The first was proposed in 1943 by McCulloch and Pitts, and captures the idea\nthat a neuron fires an action potential when a sufficiently large number of incoming excitatory\nsynapses are activated together. McCulloch and Pitts proposed the model while working at the\nUniversity of Chicago, and used it to argue that neural networks could be universal computers.\nLater they moved to MIT and collaborated with the neurophysiologist Jerome Lettvin and the\nmathematician Norbert Wiener. Pitts was an eccentric, self-taught genius who died at the\nuntimely age of 46.\na) Suppose that a cortical neuron has a resting potential of -70 mV. If its voltage is driven to the\nthreshold value of -50 mV, it generates an action potential. The neuron receives about 10,000\nexcitatory synapses. If a single synapse is activated, it produces a small change in voltage, an\nexcitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) with amplitude of 0.5 mV. Let's make the\napproximation that the EPSPs sum approximately linearly if multiple synapses are activated\nsimultaneously. How many synapses must be activated simultaneously in order to make the\nneuron fire an action potential?\nb) Let x1,...,xn be the n inputs to the neuron. Let y be its output. Both inputs and output are\nassumed to be binary, taking on the values 0 (inactive) or 1 (active). Then the McCulloch-Pitts\nmodel neuron is\ny = 1,\nxi\ni=1\nn\n\"\n# $,\n0,\notherwise\n%\n& '\n( '\nThe neuron becomes active (y=1) when the number of active inputs is greater than or equal to the\ninteger-valued threshold θ.1 If we want to model the cortical neuron of part (a), how would we\nset the parameters θ and n?\n1 Note that gradations in firing rate among active neurons are ignored for simplicity. The full\nMcCulloch-Pitts model also includes inhibitory synapses, but only excitatory synapses are\nconsidered here.\n\n2. Pattern completion by a Hebbian cell assembly. In class we discussed the CA3-specific\nNR1 knockout mouse that was generated in the Tonegawa lab. If the knockout mouse learned the\nMorris water maze with multiple visual cues present, but was tested after some cues were\nremoved, then its performance was significantly worse than that of a normal mouse. It was\nproposed that this was due to defective performance of the hippocampal CA3 network at \"pattern\ncompletion.\" Let's try to understand the phenomenon of pattern completion in a network of\nMcCulloch-Pitts model neurons. Pattern completion is the Hebbian conception of how a memory\ncan be retrieved from synaptic connections.\na) Figure A shows a lot of neurons, symbolized by circles. There are two cell assemblies, each\ncontaining four neurons. A line symbolizes two excitatory synapses between a pair of neurons,\none in each direction. Describe what activity patterns could have previously created the cell\nassemblies through Hebbian synaptic plasticity. This is the Hebbian conception of how\nmemories are stored in synaptic connections. Before the cell assemblies were created, you can\nassume that there were very weak synapses between all pairs of neurons. Such weak synapses are\nnot drawn in Figure A; only the strong ones are shown.\nb) In Figure B, two neurons in one cell assembly have become active (symbolized by red). (They\nwere activated by synaptic inputs from some sensory source, which are not shown). Suppose that\nall neurons are described by the McCulloch-Pitts model with a threshold of θ=2. Will pattern\ncompletion occur, i.e., will the whole cell assembly become active? Explain your answer.\nc) Suppose that the threshold is θ=3. Will pattern completion occur in Figure B? Explain your\nanswer.\nd) Now consider a more general case. Suppose that all cell assemblies contain n neurons, and all\nneurons have the same threshold θ. Suppose that k neurons of a cell assembly are activated by\nsensory input. Characterize the conditions under which pattern completion occurs.\n\n3. Voltage dependence of the NMDA receptor. At glutamate synapses, AMPA and NMDA\nreceptor types are typically colocalized. The conductance of the NMDA receptor depends on\nvoltage; the channel is blocked by magnesium unless the membrane is depolarized. The fraction\nof receptors that are not blocked by magnesium is given by\nB(V) =\n1+ 0.33exp(\"0.06V)\na) Graph this function from V = -100 mV to 0 mV.\nb) Suppose that you could magically clamp the voltage of a neuron at any value that you like.\nSuppose also that you could measure the change in the conductance of the neuron due to\nstimulation of an incoming glutamate synapse. (Both of these can be accomplished by using the\nvoltage clamp method to record from a neuron in a brain slice preparation.) You measure the\nconductance change while the brain slice is bathed in three different solutions,\ni)\nSaline solution plus CNQX\nii)\nSaline solution plus CNQX plus AP5\niii)\nSaline solution plus CNQX minus magnesium\nand while the neuron is held at two different voltages, -70 mV and 0 mV. The saline solution\nmimics the extracellular milieu in vivo. CNQX is an AMPA receptor antagonist. AP5 is an\nNMDA receptor antagonist.\nThe three solutions and two voltages make for a total of six different conditions. In each\ncondition, you measure a conductance change. Suppose that the amplitude of the conductance\nchange with solution (iii) and 0 mV is denoted by the value 1, and all other amplitudes are\nmeasured relative to that. Now calculate all five of the other amplitudes."

How to study for the final:\na. FINAL IS ON DEC. 20th FROM 912 IN DUPONT\nb. 2/3 of the final will be on new material = 30 multiple choice & ~2 long answers\nc. 1/3 of the final will be on old material = 15 multiple choice & ~2 long answers\nd. All lectures, assigned chapter readings and problem sets are fair game\nII. Brief review of material:\na. CHEMICAL CONTROL OF THE BRAIN\ni. Lecture: 11/14\nii. Readings: Chapter 15\nb. BRAIN DISORDERS AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE\ni. Lecture: 11/19\nii. Readings: Prof. Tsai PowerPoint Presentation (on MIT Server) & Chapter 22\nc. EATING AND MOTIVATION (CHEM. CONTROL OF BRAIN II)\ni. Lecture: 11/26\nii. Reading: Chapter 16\nd. ATTENTION\ni. Lecture: 12/03\nii. Reading: Prof. Desimone PowerPoint Presentation (on MIT Server) & Chapter 21\nCHEMICAL CONTROL OF THE BRAIN\nPatterns of communication in the nervous system [figure 15.1; page 483]\n(1) Pointtopoint systems - neurons synapse on a few neurons [ex. Dorsal thalamus to neocortex]\n(2) Hormones released by the secretory hypothalamus [pages 484489]\na. Secretory hypothalamus regulates homeostasis\ni. Homeostasis = maintenance of body's internal environment (temp, blood volume,\npressure, oxygen and glucose concentrations.\nb. Structure of secretory hypothalamus\ni. Three functional zones: lateral, medial, and periventricular\nii. Periventricular zone: contains groups of cells:\n1. SCN (suprachiasmatic nucleus) - synchronizes circadian rhythms\n2. controls autonomic nervous system (ANS)\n3. neurosecretory cells that innervate pituitary\nc. Control of posterior pituitary\ni. Magnocellular neurosecretory cells extend axons down into posterior pituitary\nii. These cells release chemicals (neurohormones) directly into capillaries of posterior lobe\n(into the general circulation)\nADH (vasopressin):\noxytocin:\nImage removed due to\ncopyright restrictions.\n\nd. Control of anterior pituitary\ni. Note: anterior pituitary is an actual gland, while posterior pituitary is part of the brain\nii. Parvocellular neurosecretory cells do not extend all the way into the lobe\niii. The cells release hypophysiotropic hormones into the hypothalamopituitary portal\ncirculation (capillaries that run the stalk of the pituitary and branch into anterior lobe)\niv. The hypophysiotropic hormones bind to receptors in pituitary and activation of receptors\ncauses cells to secrete or stop secreting hormones into the general circulation.\nACTH:\nFSH & LH:\nTSH:\nPRL:\nGH:\n(3) Networks of neurons of ANS activate tissues in the body\na. Perventricular zone hypothalamus also controls the ANS; nucleus of solitary tract\nb. Unlike the somatic motor system that controls targets via a monosynaptic pathway, ANS uses a\ndisynaptic pathway\nc. Actions of ANS are usually carried out without conscious control and are typically multiple\nwidespread and relatively slow (in comparison to somatic motor system).\nd. Two divisions: sympathetic vs. parasympathtic\ne. Enteric division (\"little brain\")\ni. Neural system found in the lining of the esophagus, stomach, intestines, pancreas, and\ngallbladder. Controls the physiological process of transport and digestion of food.\nii. Relatively independent of CNS, but supplementary control from sympathetic and\nparasympathetic. (ie. Increased activity of sympathetic nervous system - decreases\ndigestive function during stress response)\n(4) Diffuse modulatory systems have divergent axonal projections\na. Core system of small set of neurons (most from brainstem) influence many other neurons (axons\nmake contact with more than 100,000 pathways).\nb. Not classical synapses; synapses release neurotransmitter into extracellular fluid and can diffuse\nto many neurons.\nImage removed due to\ncopyright restrictions.\n\nc. Psychoactive drugs:\ni. Hallucinogens - produces hallucinations\n1. ex. LSD = agonist at presynaptic serotonin receptors; inhibits raphe nuclei firing\nii. Stimulants\n1. ex. Cocaine and amphetamine - blocks catecholamine uptake, works on DA\nand NE systems; increases alertness and decreases appetitie\nBRAIN DISORDERS AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE\n(1) Brain Disorders - Mental Illness Chapter 22\na. Anxiety Disorders: inappropriate expression of fear (or fear that is not adaptive)\ni. Biological Basis\n1. stress response = hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis mediated response\n2. regulation of HPA by amygdala - activation of amygdale stimulates CRH release\n3. regulation of HPA by hippocampus - activation of hippocampus suppresses\nCRH release; feedback inhibition\nii. Treatments\n1. psychotherapy: repeated exposure to stimuli that causes anxiety\n2. anxiolytic drugs: benzodiazepines (modulates GABA); SSRIs (selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitor)\nb. Affective Disorder: mood disorders\n\ni. Biological Basis\n1. monoamine hypothesis - depression is result of deficit in NE and/or 5HT diffuse\nmodulatory system in brain\n2. Diathesisstress hypothesis (\"diathesis\" = predisposition for a disease) -\ndepression is result of predisposition to disease and environmental factors;\ncauses changes in HPA axis\nii. Treatments\n1. electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)\n2. psychotherapy - patient overcome negative views of themselves and future\n3. Antidepressant drugs - Tricyclic compounds, SSRIs, NEselective reuptake\ninhibitors; MAOi\n4. Lithium - highly effective in stabilizing mood of bipolar patients\nc. Schizophrenia: characterized by a loss of contact with reality and a disruption of thought,\nperception, mood and movement\ni. Symptoms\n1. positive symptoms = presence of abnormal thoughts behaviors (ex. Delusions,\nhallucinations, disorganized speech, etc.)\n2. negative symptoms = absence of normal responses (ex. Reduced expression of\nemotion, flatness of affect, poverty of speech, memory impairment, etc.)\nii. Biological Basis\n1. genes and environment\n2. dopamine hypothesis - activation of DA receptors in mesocorticolimbic system\n3. glutamate hypothesis - diminished activation of NMDA receptors\niii. Treatments\n1. neuroleptics - act on DA receptors, reduce positive symptoms, however side\neffects include Parkinsonlike symptoms and tardive dyskinesia\n(2) Alzheimer's Disease - Prof. Tsai's PowerPoint presentation\na. Pathological features of AD\ni. Brain atrophy\nii. Amyloid plaques\n1. Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) - Aβ - Amyloid plaques\n2. Genetics of AD: mutations in APP, secretase enzymes, and ApoE4\n3. Example Experiment: found transgenic mice over expressing APP had memory\nimpairment and accumulated a compound called Aβ*56\ni. to test if Aβ*56 is important for memory impairment, gave young health\nrats purified Aβ*56 and found memory impairment\niii. Neurofibrillary Tangles (NFT)\n1. Tau - PTau (phosphorylated Tau) - Tangles\n2. Tau is usually bound to microtubules. When phosphorylated by kinases (CDK5,\netc.), Tau unbinds and aggregates into tangles.\n3. Tangles also found in other diseases.\n4. Staining NFT by silver staining, dyes, antibodies, etc.\n5. Example exp.: neurodegeneration in an inducible mutant Tau transgenic mouse\nImages removed due to\ncopyright restrictions.\n\nEATING AND MOTIVATION\n(1) Three parts of hypothalamic regulation of homeostasis:\na. Humoral response: hypothalamic neurons respond to sensory signals by stimulating or\ninhibiting release of pituitary hormones into bloodstream\nb. Viseromotor response: neurons in hypothalamus respond to sensory signals by adjusting\nbalance of sympathetic and parasympathetic outputs of ANS\nc. Somatic motor response: lateral hypothalamic neurons inciting an appropriate somatic motor\nbehavioral response (ex. Generating warmth by moving)\n(2) Longterm regulation of feeding behavior\na. Anabolism = the assembly of macromolecules such as glycogen and triglycerides from\nsimple precursors\nb. Catabolism = process of breaking down complex macromolecules\nc. Lipostatic hypothesis = a hypothesis prosing that body fat is maintained homeostatically at\na specific level\ni. Must be communication between adipose tissue to the brain.\nii. Hormone leptin (encoded by ob gene) is released by adipocytes (fat cells) and\nregulates body mass by directly acting on hypothalamic neurons that decrease\nappetite and increase energy expenditure.\nd. Lateral hypothalamic syndrome = lesions of lateral hypothalamus lead to anorexia\ne. Ventromedial hypothalamic syndrome = lesions of ventromedial hypo. lead to obesity\nf.\nEffects of elevated leptin - inhibit feeding behavior\n(figure 16.8, p. 517)\nAnorectic peptides = peptides that diminish appetite (αMSH or CART)\ng. Effects of decreased leptin - stimulates feeding behavior\n(figure 16.9, p. 517)\nOrexigenic peptides = peptides that stimulate feeding behavior (NPY and AgRP)\n(3) Shortterm regulation of feeding behavior\na. Satiety signals = a factor that reduces the drive to eat without causing sickness\ni. Examples include gastric distention and cholecystokinin (CCK) released by the\nintestinal cells in response to food.\nb. Ghrelin = a peptide secreted by cells in the stomach that stimulates appetite by activating\norexigenic neurons in the hypothalamus\nc. Insulin = a hormone released by the β cells of the pancreas; regulates blood glucose levels\nand important for anabolic and catabolic metabolism\n(4) Why do we eat?\na. Electrical selfstimulation = electrical stimulation that an animal can voluntarily deliver to a\nportion of its brain (rat presses lever to give electrical stimulation)\ni. Repeated selfstimulation when stimulating electrode was placed in areas of medial\nforebrain bundle\nb. Dopamine - stimulation of dopamine axons in lateral hypothalamus produced food cravings;\ndepletion of DA resulted in animals liking food, but don't seek food.\n\nc. Serotonin abnormalities in brain serotonin regulation believed to contribute to eating\ndisorders\n(5) Overview (know leptin, ghrelin, and insulin)\nATTENTION\nThe state of selectively processing simultaneous sources of information\n(1) Behavioral consequences of attention:\na. Enhanced detection (experiment on p. 646)\ni. Observer looks at fixation point, then give a neutral, invalid or valid cue\nii. Cueing to the correct side of where the target would appear made it easier to detect\nthe flashed target\niii. Covert shift in attention even though eyes don't' move\nb. Faster reaction times (experiment on p. 647)\ni. Attention can alter the speed of visual processing or the time it takes to make a\ndecision to press the button\n(2) Neglect Syndrome: an attentional disorder\na. Appears to ignore objects, people and sometimes his own body to one side of the center of\ngaze. Common w/ right hemisphere damage\nImage removed due to\ncopyright restrictions.\n\n(3) Physiological effects of attention:\na. fMRI imaging of attention to location (p. 649650)\ni. enhancement in detection and reaction time are selective for spatial location\nii. pattern of brain activity move retinotopically: different areas of the brain light up\ndepending on the location of the attended section\nb. PET imaging of attention to features (p.651)\ni. Samedifferent task; both selectiveattention and dividedattention\nii. Different areas of cortex had higher activity when different attributes of stimuli were\nbeing discriminated\niii. Numerous cortical areas appear to be affected by attention and the greatest\nattention effects are seen \"late\" rather than \"early\" areas in the visual system\nc. Enhanced neuronal response in parietal cortex (p.652)\ni. a neuron in cortex responds to a target stimuli\nii. the response is enhanced if the target presented is followed by a saccade to the\ntarget\niii. enhancement is spatial selective b/c it is not seen if a saccade occurs in response to\na stimulus not in the receptive field\nd. Receptive field change in Area V4: (p.654)\ni. difference in ease of detection at the attended and unattended locations is based on\nthe higher activity evoked by effective stimuli at the attended location = location\nspecificity\n(4) How is attention directed?\na. Pulvinar nucleus: structure in thalamus in which lesions result in abnormally show responses\nto stimuli on the contralateral side\nb. Frontal eye fields (FEF): cortical area that is involved in the production of saccadic eye\nmovements and may play a role in the guidance of attention\ni. has motor fields = small areas in visual field\nii. if significant stimulation passes through FEF, then eyes rapidly make a saccade to\nthe motor field of the stimulate neuron\niii. FEF stimulation mimics both the physiological and behavioral effects of attention\nend of part I\nImage removed due to\ncopyright restrictions."

serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine - as well as\nacetylcholine, seem to perform broad modulatory functions within the brain\n2.\nMonoaminergic and cholinergic neurons emanate from discrete nuclei in the\nbrainstem and innervate most regions of the brain with long, diffuse projections\n3.\nThese transmitter systems predominantly act through metabotropic receptors, and\ntherefore have a relatively slow effect, although there are exceptions, such as the\nnicotinic receptor and the 5-HT3 receptor\n4.\nMonoaminergic and cholinergic brain systems play important roles in Sleep,\narousal, reward and mood.\n5.\nSeveral degenerative diseases of the nervous system result from selective loss of\none or more of these systems - Parkinson's disease (dopamine), Alzheimer's\ndisease (acetylcholine)\n6.\nMany recreational drugs, such as amphetamines, cocaine, LSD, ecstacy and\nnicotine, have their effects due to interference with monoamine transmitter\nsystems\n\nCo-transmission\nHenry Dale\nDale's principle:\nEach neuron uses one\nneurotransmitter and\none transmitter only -

(This tamping iron was 3'7\" long, 1.25\" in diameter, and weighed 13.5 lbs.)\nHe miraculously survived the incident. Which glial cells might have played a large role in his\ndefiance of death?\n\na) Schwann cells\n\nb) oligodendrocytes\n\nc) microglia\n\nd) astrocytes\n\n3) Knowing what you know about phospholipid bilayers, if you wanted to build your own membrane protein,\nwhat would your amino acids need to have in order to stay in the membrane?\n\na) hydrophobic groups\n\nb) hydrophilic groups\n\nc) ionic selectivity\n\nd) heptanary structure\n\n4) Golgi and Ramon y Cajal disagreed over the neuron doctrine; their argument was not resolved until the\nadvent of the electron microscope because:\n\na) Synapses are destroyed by the fixation process used for light microscopy; fixatives used for the\nmore sensitive electron microscopy technique preserve the synapse.\n\nb) The limit of resolution of the light microscope is 100 nm, whereas the electron microscope has\na limit of resolution of 0.1 nm.\n\nc) The Golgi stain only stains a small percentage of neurons, and even then not completely; the\nchances of finding a pair of interconnected neurons is too small to determine whether neurons\ncommunicate by contact, not continuity.\n\nd) The Nissl stain, which is necessary to resolve synapses, can only be used with the electron\nmicroscope.\n\ne) The Golgi stain, which is necessary to resolve synapses, can only be used with the electron\nmicroscope.\n\n5) There are two types of neurites: axons and dendrites. Which of the following is true about these\nneurites?:\n\na) Dendrites are relatively short in length (about 2mm), have a uniform diameter along their\nentire length, and act as the antennae of the neuron to receive incoming signals or input.\n\nb) Axons are relatively long (can be over a meter), if they branch at all, they do so at right angles,\nand act like \"wires\" that carry the output of the neurons.\n\nc) The power of the Golgi stain is that, unlike the Nissl stain, it reveals the elaborate dendritic\nstructure of the neuron; nevertheless, neither stain fills the axon.\n\nd) ALL OF THE ABOVE ARE TRUE\n\n6) Charles Bell and Francois Magendie cut dorsal and ventral spinal roots in experimental animals; what\nwere they able to show with these experiments?\n\na) That nerves contain a mixture of many nerve fibers, some that carry sensory information from\nthe skin and others that carry motor information to the muscles.\n\nb) That sensory and motor information is carried bidirectionally in the same nerves from the skin\nand to the muscles.\n\nc) That the central and peripheral nervous systems are functionally distinct subdivisions, which\nhave no anatomical correlates.\n\nd) That ventral roots and dorsal roots carry nerves that primarily supply the autonomic nervous\nsystem.\n\ne) That ventral roots and dorsal roots carry nerves that primarily supply the somatic nervous\nsystem.\n\n7) Oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells differ in what way:\n\na) Oligodendrocytes are found in the central nervous system, whereas Schwann cells are found in\nthe peripheral nervous system.\n\nb) Oligodendrocytes are myelinating glia, whereas Schwann cells are microglia\n\nc) One oligodendrocyte will surround one axon, whereas each Schwann cell affiliates with several\naxons.\n\nd) Oligodendrocytes form nodes of Ranvier, while Schwann cells do not.\n\n8) Kinesin and dynein are proteins that bind microtubules. Which of the following is FALSE?\n\na) They convert chemical energy contained in phosphate bonds into mechanical energy\n\nb) They establish plasma membrane composition at the axon terminal by selectively moving\ndifferent receptor subtypes into and out of the terminal.\n\nc) They mediate gene transcription by carrying signaling proteins at the terminal back to the\nnucleus\n\nd) Kinesin is involved in retrograde transport, while dynein is involved in anterograde transport.\n\ne) Their function can be hijacked by viruses and neuroscientists to serve their own purposes\n\n9) Which of the following is TRUE about ribosomes?\n\na) They are necessary for transcription\n\nb) They are found dotting the surface of smooth ER\n\nc) They are not found in glia\n\nd) They bind mRNA\n\n10) Which of the following is TRUE about axons?\n\na) They are only found in neurons\n\nb) They contain rough ER so proteins can be synthesized throughout their length\n\nc) You can show retrograde transport of proteins in axons by injecting a cell's soma with\nradioactive amino acids.\n\nd) A & B are true\n\ne) B & C are true\n\nAnswers to Review Questions\n\n1) B\n2) C\n3) A\n4) B\n5) B\n6) A\n7) A\n8) D\n9) D\n10) A\n\nExplanations, Additional Info for Select Questions\n\nQuestion 2\n\n-\nSchwann cells: myelinating glia, provide layers of membrane that insulate axons; PNS\n-\noligodendrocytes: myelinating glia, provide layers of membrane that insulate axons; CNS\n-\nmicroglia: phagocytes that remove debris left by dead or dying cells\n-\nastrocytes: glia, fills spaces between neurons (regulating whether neurites can grow); regulates\nchemical content of extracellular space\n\nMyelin sheath; exposed areas are known as nodes of Ranvier; speeds propagation of nerve impulses, is\nknown as saltatory conduction\n\nQuestion 4\n\nLimit of resolution refers to the distance for which two points are distinguishable.

This is because membrane potential refers to the charge inside of the cell compared to the charge outside the\ncell. There can be a large change in charge even when there is a negligent change in ionic concentrations.\n\nThink of it using this (made-up and very imperfect) example: there are 1,000,000 ions of valence +1 inside and outside the\ncell; the charge difference is currently 0. If 1,000 of those ions move into the cell, then the charge inside the cell is going\nto be +2,000 compared to the outside of the cell. And yet the concentration ratio is 1,001,000 to 999,000, which is still\nrelatively close to 1.\n\nAnswers to Review Questions\n\n1) D\n2) B\n3) B\n4) A\n5) C\n6) C\n7) D (A and B)\n8) B\n9) C\n10) A\n11) A\n12) A\n13) B\n14) D\n15) E\n16) C\n17) D\n\nExplanations, Additional Info for Select Questions\n\nQuestion 6\n\nRemember that neurons have high potassium conductance at rest (a lot of potassium channels - not voltage-gated ones -\nare open at rest). Thus, when adding more KCl outside of the cell, the additional potassium will have an effect on\nmembrane potential. The increase in chloride does not have as much of an effect, because chloride conductance is low at\nrest. When extracellular potassium increases, more potassium will enter the cell (because of concentration gradient and\nattraction to negative charge inside cell). The membrane potassium will become more positive. (There was some\nconfusion re: the wording of the answer; increasing KCl has no effect on sodium channels. When the answer choice says\nthat membrane potential \"gets closer to Na+ equilibrium potential,\" it just means that the membrane potential is more\npositive.)\n\nQuestion 7\n\nRefer to the modified Ohm's Law.\n\nQuestion 8\n\nThe question states that ion X is equal in concentration on both sides of the brain, thus diffusion does not play a part.\nElectricity and charge does. Opening up channels permeable to X+ will result in X+ flooding into the cell because it is\nattracted to the negative charge inside the cell.\n\nQuestion 17\n\nEpileptic seizures means there is an excess of electrical activity in the brain."

Your book also lists another criterion for classifying a molecule as a neurotransmitter. When experimentally\napplied, the molecule must produce a response in the postsynaptic cell that mimics the response produced by the release\nof the molecule by the presynaptic cell.\n\nQuestion 3\n\nRead pages 141-152 for information on neurotransmitter chemistry. Here are specifics about the catecholamine\nneurotransmitters (DA, NE, epinephrine) and pathway:\n-\ntyrosine is converted to dopa in the cytosol by the action of enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)\n-\ndopa is converted to dopamine (DA) in the cytosol by the action of enzyme dopa decarboxylase\n-\ndopamine is converted to norepinephrine (NE or noradrenaline) in vesicles by the action of enzyme dopamine β-\nhydroxylase (DBH)\n-\nnorepinephrine is converted to epinephrine (or adrenaline) in cytosol by the action of enzyme phentolamine N-\nmethyltransferase (PNMT)\n\nThe entire pathway does not occur in all neurons, i.e. a dopaminergic neuron will not convert DA to NE. Interesting note:\nenzyme DBH is located only in vesicles, which is why the conversion to NE occurs in vesicles. For a neuron that releases\nepinephrine, DA is transported into vesicles and converted to NE; the vesicles let out NE so that it can be converted into\nepinephrine, which is then transported back into vesicles to await an action potential.\n\nQuestion 4\n\nPage 142. Many neurons violate Dale's Principle, namely peptide-containing neurons.\n\nQuestion 6\n\nPeptide neurotransmitters are one type. The other two: amino acids and amines. Peptide neurotransmitters are packed\ninto secretory granules by the Golgi apparatus. Amino acid and amine neurotransmitters are packed into vesicles by\nprotein transporters embedded in vesicle membrane. Secretory granules are larger than other vesicles; they appear dark\nin electron microscopy.\n\nQuestion 7\n\nPage 103. Inspired by a dream, Otto Loewi isolated a frog heart with the vagal innervation nerve intact. When the nerve\nwas stimulated by electricity, the heart slowed. When Loewi applied to the nerve the solution that the heart was bathed\nin, he got the same result. This suggests that neurons release chemicals as messengers.\n\nQuestion 12\n\nGap junctions (pages 103-5) are located at electrical synapses, a narrow gap spanned by connexin proteins (six connexin\nproteins form a connexon). The channel allows ions to pass directly from one cell to another. Electrical synapses are\nbidirectional. The cells connected by them are referred to as \"electrically coupled.\" Transmission across gap junctions is\nfast and fail-safe."

Input from right eye\no Chiasm is cut down the middle? Peripheral vision\no Left optic tract is cut? Right visual field\n- Targets of projection: LGN (thalamus) to striate cortex, hypothalamus, superior colliculus.\n\nLateral Geniculate Nucleus\n- Six layers labeled 1 through 6; most ventral layer is 1\n- Retinal information separated by eye and ganglion cell type\no Ipsilateral axons synapse on LGN layers 2, 3, 5; contralateral axons on 1, 4, 6\no Magnocellular LGN layers (1 and 2) receive input from M-type ganglion cells;\nparvocellular LGN layers (3-6) receive input from P-type; and koniocellular layers (lie just\nventral to each numbered layer) receive input from non-M-non-P\n- Receptive fields on LGH neurons almost identical to those of the ganglion cells that innervate them\n\nStriate Cortex (V1, Area 17, primary visual cortex)\n- Retinotopy (2D surface of retina is mapped onto 2D surface of LGN, striate)\no Mapping of visual field often distorted (greater representation of fovea)\no Discrete point of light can activate many cells in the retina, more in target structures,\nbecause of overlapping receptive fields; activity in cortex is broad distribution with peak at\nspecific retinotopic location\no Not literal map; no pictures in the brain\n- Six layers (I through VI - IV divided into A, B, and C - IVC into α and β)\n\no Most axons from LGN terminate in IVC - cell type and eye separation maintained in IVC\nMagnocellular LGN neurons project to IVCα; parvocellular to IVCβ\nRight, left eye inputs separated via ocular dominance columns (autoradiography)\nIVC neurons project to II, III, IVB Æ some information integrated, processed; II\nand III receive binocular input\no Koniocellular LGN axons project to II and III\no Radial connections (perpendicularly across all layers) vs. horizontal (within one layer)\no Outputs (II, III, IVB Æ cortical areas; V Æ superior colliculus, pons; VI Æ back to LGN)\no Blobs (seen with cytochrome oxidase) run along II, III, V, VI; interblobs (between blobs)\nreceives input from koniocellular layers of LGN\n- Receptive fields\no Binocularity\no Orientation selectivity\no Direction selectivity\no Simple and complex receptive fields\no Blob receptive fields\n\nBeyond Striate Cortex\n- Dorsal stream (\"where\" pathway)\no Motion processing\no Area MT\n- Ventral stream (\"what\" pathway)\no Area V4\no Area IT\n\nPractice Short Answer: What is meant by parallel processing in the visual system? Give examples.\n\nParallel processing is the ability of the brain to process incoming stimuli simultaneously in\ndifferent ways. This is especially important in vision.\n\nA few examples of parallel processing in vision:\n- Two eyes\n- ON and OFF bipolar cells\n- M- and P-type ganglion cells\n- Dorsal and ventral streams\n- Etc."
