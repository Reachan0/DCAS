  "course_description": "Can you make a cellphone change the world?\nNextLab is a hands-on year-long design course in which students research, develop and deploy mobile technologies for the next billion mobile users in developing countries. Guided by real-world needs as observed by local partners, students work in multidisciplinary teams on term-long projects, closely collaborating with NGOs and communities at the local level, field practitioners, and experts in relevant fields.\nStudents are expected to leverage technical ingenuity in both mobile and internet technologies together with social insight in order to address social challenges in areas such as health, microfinance, entrepreneurship, education, and civic activism. Students with technically and socially viable prototypes may obtain funding for travel to their target communities, in order to obtain the first-hand feedback necessary to prepare their technologies for full fledged deployment into the real world (subject to guidelines and limitations).",

Each unit represents approximately 14 hours of work. First is the number of units assigned for recitation and lecture; second, the number of units for laboratory, design, or fieldwork; and third, for preparation. Add the units together to obtain the total credit hours for a subject.]\n\nMaximum class size: 30 students\n\nPrerequisites: Permission of instructor for undergraduates.\n\nTeaching Team\n\nCourse Sponsors\n\nTelmex\n, Latin America's largest telecoms operator\n\nAmerica Movil\n, fifth largest mobile network in the world\n\nNokia\n, Largest handset manufacturer in the developing world\n\nNext Billion Network\n@ MIT Media Lab\n\nPotential Project Partners and Projects\n\nEconomic Empowerment\n\nMacosa: Multilevel marketing for microfinance, Ecuador\n\nPlaNet Finance: Mobile pre-screening for microfinance, Argentina\n\nITESM (Monterrey Tec): Agriculture pricing for market efficiency and disintermediation, Mexico/Nicaragua\n\nUnited Villages: M-commerce interface, India\n\nEducation\n\nTelmex: Mobile social network for students in low-income communities, Mexico\n\nITESM (Monterrey Tec): M-learning for rural literacy instructors, Mexico\n\nHealth\n\nCIDRZ: Mobile diagnostics for cervical cancer, Zambia\n\nGE Healthcare: Tele-radiology with Ultrasound on Mobiles, Belize\n\nEnvironment and Community\n\nFlow, Inc: Mobile/GIS InnovGreen Technology, Vietnam\n\nCatholic Relief Services: Mobile Early Warning System for Disaster Management, India\n\nThe Next Billion in Our Neighborhood (partnership with the City of Boston)\n\n\"Thrive in Five\": Mobile services for parents of 0-5 year olds\n\n\"Eat or Heat\": Can we help people manage their money better?\n\nCourse Structure\n\nThis course has two main components: In-class Discussion (generally on Mondays), and Guided Design Process (generally on Wednesdays). Special guest lectures and other class activities will also occur throughout the term.\n\nIn-class Discussions: Individual students will be assigned one research paper to read and facilitate discussion during class. We expect to designate an average of three student-led discussion every class (20-30 mins each).\n\nGuided Design Process: Student teams are expected to present completed project milestones to the class and submit their work to structured sessions of expert and peer reviews. We expect half of the teams to present in a given week, with the other half presenting the following week.\n\nProject Teams\n\nThe projects are the central part of the course and will be done in teams of three to five students. Each team will schedule a formal project meeting time as well as meeting times with its Team Advisors and Project Partners throughout the semester.\n\nBecause important work for this course will be done during class time, attendance is essential. Students missing a class or meeting should notify their instructors and teammates in advance and make arrangements to make up the work.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nIn-class participation and paper in-class discussion\n\n20% (individual grade)\n\nWorking prototype\n\n40% (team grade)\n\nSustainability plan\n\n20% (team grade)\n\nEnd-of-term public presentation\n\n20% (both individual and team grade)\n\nCourse Schedule\n\nWEEK #\n\nIN-CLASS DISCUSSION AND CASE STUDIES\n\nGUIDED DESIGN PROCESS\n\nIntroduction to NextLab\n\nProject proposal presentations\n\nNeeds assessment\n\nTeam formation\n\nClass logistics\n\nPlanning ICT4D interventions\n\nEconomic and social conditions\n\nTechnology survey / ICT penetration\n\nNo class\n\nMilestone 1: elevator pitch, including related work\n\nSocial and cultural considerations\n\nMilestone 1 (cont.)\n\nICT4D history\n\nMilestone 2: needs assessment results\n\nNo class (holiday)\n\nMilestone 2 (cont.)\n\nInterfaces\n\nMilestone 3: system design and initial implementation results\n\nHealth\n\nMilestone 3 (cont.)\n\nDisaster management\n\nHealth (cont.)\n\nMilestone 4: sustainability and financial factors\n\nNo class (holiday)\n\nMilestone 4 (cont.)\n\nEducation\n\nMobile money and transactions\n\nEnvironment and other applications\n\nMilestone 5: demo\n\nMilestone 5 (cont.)\n\nMilestone 6: final presentation practice\n\nMilestone 6 (cont.)\n\nConclusion\n\nFinal presentation event",

What is the impact of ICT use on the\npedagogic knowledge and practice of\nteachers and the communities in which they\nlive and work?\n2. What is the impact of ICT‐enhanced teaching\non student achievement and motivation?\n3. How can teacher education and training be\ndeveloped to ensure teacher capacity to\nexploit the potential for ICT?\n\nThe approach: case studies\n- When: March 2001‐May 2003\n- Where: 2 cities\n- Cario, Egypt\n- East Cape Province, South Africa\n- Who: teachers led by research staff\n- 48 primary school teachers (working in pairs)\nacross 24 schools (12/location)\n- DEEP partner organizations leading a\ndevelopment program for the teachers\n\nMethodology: teacher and school selection criteria\n- Radio announcement publicized upcoming study\nand requested expressions of interest\n- 91 schools applied\n- Final selection heterogeneous wrt ICT adoption\n- 33% without electricity\n- 50% of schools without telephony\n- 75% without any form of ICT\n- Teachers interested and committed to\ndeveloping their skills\n\nForms of ICT employed\n- Laptops\n- Desktops\n- Hand‐helds\n- LCD panel\n- Data projector\n- Digital cameras and video recorders\n- Printer‐scanner‐copiers\n- Mobile phones\n\nProgram: 3 terms, teacher + student\n- Term 1: Introducing DEEP, the project and ICT\n- Term 2: In‐school planning and practice\n- Research skills via internet and CD rom\n- Personal communication via email\n- Strengthen numeracy with real data\n- Term 3: Organizing learning and Review\n- Drafting and redrafting via word\n- Planning the writing process\n- Reflection on achievement\n\nKey Findings: Qualitative and unqualified\n1. Teacher Confidence: Teachers quickly developed\nbasic computer and software skills\n2. Extending Teacher Subject Knowledge: Teachers\nbegan to use ICT to learn more about their subject\nareas\n3. Enhanced planning and preparation: Teachers using\nICT to plan lessons\n4. Building Teacher Networks: Communication\napplications led to teachers connecting and\ncollaborating\nLittle/No discussion of financial sustainability\n\nStepping back: Prioritization of funds\nExcerpt describing one of the sample schools:\nThe village is reached by an hour's difficult drive from the main\nN2 via an unmade road, offering remarkable views ... virtually\ninaccessible in the rainy season. Few adults between the age of\n20 and 50 reside there: many have died from AIDS, and\nsurviving able‐bodied adults live in towns or cities most of the\nyear round in order to make a living. On average students live\nwithin a 2‐mile radius of the school, mostly with grandparents\nor other relatives. Fees are between R10 and R30 (£1-3) per\nannum, depending on the level of study; 90% of students are\nunable to make this payment. Classrooms are mostly bare,\nconcrete‐floored constructions with dilapidated wooden\ndesks; the youngest learners are taught in dark, crowded,\nthatched rondeavaals.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\nMAS.965 / 6.976 / EC.S06 NextLab I: Designing Mobile Technologies for the Next Billion Users\nFall 2008\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Ninety percent of this total was spent by the 30\nresulted in health care per capita spending that is almost\nwealthy countries of the Organization for Economic Co-\ntwo orders of magnitude lower than in developed coun-\noperation and Development (OECD), which make up\ntries [1]. In addition, tertiary-care hospitals in developing\n20% of the world's population [8]. On average, OECD\ncountries typically consume a large proportion of overall\ncountries spent more than 11% of their gross domestic\nhealth care spending, and less than a quarter of govern-\nproduct on health, while the countries of the World\nment spending is devoted to public health measures and\nHealth Organization's (WHO) African and South-East\nclinical care in primary care settings [2,3]. Community-\nAsia regions spent 4.7% [8]. In absolute terms, low-\nbased care has the capacity for further reaching impact\nincome countries spent US$ 32 per capita on health care\nand has been shown to be effective in treatment and mon-\nin 2004, and high-income countries spent US$ 3,724 per\nitoring of HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), tuber-\ncapita.

However, they\n),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n\nBioMedical Engineering OnLine 2008, 7:18\nalso go on to state that providing basic health care to the\nworld's poor is both technically feasible and cost effective,\npotentially saving million lives annually and fuelling\ndevelopment by generating hundreds of billions of dol\nlars in new economic activity every year.\nAs Saxenian points out tertiary-care hospitals in develop\ning countries, alone may consume 30% to 50% percent of\noverstretched health budgets [2] (although they generally\nprovide the most specialized and sophisticated services\nand most clinical research, education, and training). Only\na quarter of government spending, and often less, is\ndevoted to cost-effective public health measures and to\nclinical care that is delivered in local health centers and\nother community settings. This misallocation means that\nlarge subgroups in the population, particularly the rural\npoor, have extremely limited access to health services.\nLimited government money means that some primary\ncare level treatments are free but more extensive treat\nment/care can be very costly and cause households to fall\ninto poverty [9]. The World Bank has stressed the value of\nthe primary health care interventions that are commonly\nincluded in programs to reduce childhood malnutrition\nand mortality, chiefly from infectious diseases. However,\nseveral of these highly cost-effective interventions have\nlargely been neglected, including: chemotherapy against\ntuberculosis; integrated prenatal and delivery care; mass\nprograms to de-worm children; and provision of con\ndoms along with information and education to combat\nAIDS [9].\nA recent report by the WHO projects that, over the next\ntwenty years, HIV/AIDS will account for the greatest bur\nden of disease world-wide, followed by depression and\nischemic heart disease. Smoking-related illnesses and\nHIV/AIDS will be the leading causes of death [12]. How\never, Mathers also points out that this is based upon the\nassumption that future mortality and risk factor trends in\npoor countries will have the same relationship to eco\nnomic and social development as has occurred in the\nhigher income countries over the last 50 years. If this\nassumption is wrong, then predictions may be worse.\nTherefore, in order to best allocate resources, tracking of\nhealth care problems and the evaluation of prevention\nand treatment programs (particularly where HIV/AIDS is\nconcerned) as a function of local economics and social\nattitudes is essential. Information technology has been\nproposed as an efficient method for improving the effec\ntiveness and efficiency of health care [13], and has been\nshown to be particularly useful in the context of outcome\nimprovement, cost reduction [14] and disease interven\ntion [15-20]. This article therefore concentrates, not on\nwhat health care programs and devices are likely to be use\nful, but on how information technology can be employed\nto improve our understanding of what technologies and\nhttp://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/content/7/1/18\npractices are needed, while addressing specific problems,\nsuch as information loss (and errors), long latencies in\ndelivery, and the cost of health care provision.\nTracking Health Care, Databases and\nInformation Systems\nInformation technology and electronic medical records\n(EMRs) have been shown to provide significant benefits\nin developed countries. Studies have shown that it can\nimprove patient outcomes in the management of renal\ndisease [14,21]. In another recent study of almost a mil\nlion patients in the Colorado and Northwest regions of\nthe Kaiser Permanente health care system, two years after\nelectronic health records were fully implemented, age\nadjusted rates of office visits were shown to be 9% lower\nin both regions [22]. Age adjusted primary care visits were\nshown to drop by 11% in both regions and specialty care\nvisits decreased by 5% in Colorado and 6% in the North\nwest. All decreases were significant (P < 0.0001). Wang et\nal. [23] have estimated that the net benefit from using an\nelectronic medical record for a 5-year period was $86,400\nUS per provider. Benefits accrue primarily from savings in\ndrug expenditures, improved utilization of radiology\nstudies, better capture of charges, and decreased billing\nerrors. A recent long term study of the US Veterans Health\nAdministration (VHA) has demonstrated that EMRs\nimprove efficiency by an estimated 6% per year, and that\nthe only a small number of unnecessary tests or admis\nsions resulted from the usage of their EMR [24].\nAlthough large differences exist between infrastructure\nand resources for health care in developing countries [25\n27], it is possible that EMRs are able to provide similar\nimpacts on health care in developing countries. In fact,\ngiven the poor state of medical record keeping in many\ndeveloping regions, EMRs may even lead to much larger\nimpacts on outcomes, health care efficiency and treatment\ndelivery in developing countries [28-31].\nIn 2005, Eiseman and Fossum pointed out that available\nhealth resource data for developing countries is currently\na \"patchwork of information at different levels of aggrega\ntion and resolution and of varying quality and timeliness\nthat falls short in meeting the needs of the many diverse\nobjectives and organizations that require such data\" [32].\nFurthermore, \"many current data collections rely on\nlabor-intensive collection techniques that require exten\nsive planning and the skills of specially trained teams,\nwhich can prove burdensome to those providing the data\nand may be detrimental to the data's accuracy and timeli\nness\". Eiseman and Fossum and others go on to point out\nthat existing data collections are insufficiently compre\nhensive, sometimes inaccurate, and often out of date by\nthe time the data can be acted upon [32] ([33]. Without\nsuch data, none of the parties trying to address the health\nPage 2 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n\nBioMedical Engineering OnLine 2008, 7:18\nproblems of developing countries has the required empir\nical knowledge to inform policy decisions about health\nresource mobilization and allocation, strategic planning,\npriority setting, monitoring and evaluation, advocacy,\nand general policymaking [34-36].\nEiseman and Fossum propose that any global health\nresource tracking system would contain valid, detailed\ndata (who, what, where, how much) on all health\nresources (cash and in-kind) provided in previous, current\nand the next fiscal years to all developing countries by all\npublic and private entities. Furthermore, this should be\nprovided in (almost) real time, without double-counting\nany resources. Such a system should also have the follow\ning ideal properties:\n1. Impose on any public or private entity no more than a\nminimal burden in terms of its provision of the informa\ntion needed to populate the system.\n2. Readily harmonize with and connect to the existing\ndata systems of receiving countries and all donor entities.\n3. Be easily accessible via the Web and flexibly searchable\nby every data element in a variety of languages.\n4. Enjoy broad ownership, official buy-in, and use, with\nlong-term support from a diversified funding base.\nEiseman and Fossum point out that this would require\nthat practical data systems already exist in a meaningful\nway and that they are easily accessible to the relevant\nusers. The reality is that most countries do not use digital\nhealth records, and even those who do, often have an\nextremely limited ability to facilitate searches and\nexchange data with other systems [37,38]. Furthermore,\nthere is no clear consensus on how the data should be col\nlected, and in what format should the data be stored.\nThese are two key issues in the development of a useful\nmedical health record.\nEssentially, there are two possible approaches to the stor\nage of data in an EMR. The first prescribes a top-down\nnational (or international) schema for the medical data,\nsuch as the GEHR/openEHR standard, the CEN EN 13606\nEHRcom standard, and the HL7 standard. (See Sanroma et\nal. [39] for a good overview of these standards.) The major\ndisadvantages of these approaches are that they are diffi\ncult to implement for small projects and are not always\nsuited to primary care-level information collection. An\nalternative approach is to employ a system that is built\nfrom the bottom-up, such as OpenMRS [40-45]. These\napproaches lead to a streamlined system that provides\nonly for the needs of the project, with little overhead.\nHowever, the system is also standardized (for integration\nhttp://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/content/7/1/18\nwith other software, and databases) and extensible so that\nother data can easily be added to the system.\nIn both approaches, the EMR should be built with open-\nsource software. This has several advantages over closed\nproprietary systems. Firstly, the system is more 'future\nproof', being able to withstand the changes in libraries,\noperating systems and hardware. This avoids the prob\nlems of having to reverse-engineer data structures and\nrecode interfaces. Furthermore, software can be written in\na cross-platform manner, providing maximum choice and\nflexibility for users. Secondly, open-source software is\nlicense free and allows everyone to benefit from any devel\nopments made by others, minimizing the costs to every\none involved. Vital funds can then be spent on the\nsupport and augmentation of the code base. Use of open-\nsource software can also lead to an increase in competi\ntion and allow developing countries to support their own\nsoftware and applications and the development of related\nbusinesses. Examples of such competition stimulation\ncan be seen in the adoption of Linux and Apache by the\nApple Corporation. Furthermore, open-source licensing\ncan allow small and medium-sized companies to build a\nbusiness around the support of medical databases. It\nshould be noted that open-source does not always mean\nthat software is always supplied at no-cost to the user, and\nsuch software can be linked to proprietary libraries if the\nsource-code base is distributed under an appropriate\nlicense, such as the modified BSD or LGPL licenses.\nThirdly, it is generally easier to detect and fix bugs in\nopen-source software, and compliance with standards is\nmore easily enforced. In particular, standards concerning\nsecurity and protected health information are more easily\naudited when a system is open.\nSince electronic data flow must involve hardware at some\npoint, hardware communication issues must also be con\nsidered. The problems of integrating hardware with pro\nprietary interfaces and back-end databases are well-known\nin the developed world, and these issues do not benefit\neither the patient or the health care system. That is not to\nsay that private enterprise's role in healthcare in develop\ning countries is unimportant (and we leave this involved\ndiscussion for another time), but the foundations of\ndevice communication should be sufficiently open in\norder to maximize the usefulness of any medical record\nsystem.\nIn any EMR, it is also advantageous to include standard\nized medical languages (such as the Unified Medical Lan\nguage System; UMLS), which have multiple-language\ntranslations, enable multi-lingual versions of the elec\ntronic health record and help aggregate data across\nregions and nations. Errors due to regional differences in\nthe names of drugs, or colloquial terminology for proce-\nPage 3 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n\nBioMedical Engineering OnLine 2008, 7:18\ndures can lead missed opportunities to treat or even to\nserious medical errors.\nSuccessful technology implementation requires\nmulti-factorial approach\nUnlike in developed countries where technology imple\nmentation can be focused and rely on existing infrastruc\nture, in developing countries a multi-factorial approach is\nnecessary if technology is going to be implemented and\nmaintained successfully. Among some of the factors that\nmust be taken into account are, corruption, inequalities\nwithin the country, imposition of sub-optimal policies or\ntechnologies by authorities, and the lack of or incorrect\ninformation. Corruption plagues health systems in all\ncountries. In developing countries, one common form is\nthe requisite informal payments to underpaid health staff\nwhich creates a significant barrier to care [9]. A 2003 study\nof the government health system in Albania found that\ntreatment was withheld in the absence of an informal pay\nment and that patients included the estimated costs of\ninformal payments in their decisions to seek care [46,47].\nA conceivable offshoot of this established corruption in\nlight of improved health care technology would be the\nmisuse of technology resources or the increase of existing\ninformal payments for their use. In establishing technol\nogy-focused health programs in developing countries,\nmonitoring of users as well as data collection and entry\nmust be a significant concern, beginning in the planning\nstages of program implementation.\nIn conceptualizing technology-based improvements to\nhealth care in the developing world, it is essential to bear\nin mind the disparities of access and quality of care that\ncurrently exist within the health system in any given coun\ntry and how the planned improvements may exacerbate\nthose inequities. If technological improvements are cen\ntered on urban areas, they will likely not impact the health\nstatus of the rural poor and, thus, may only marginally\nbenefit the country's overall health indicators [48]. On an\nimplementation level, the strata of the health care hierar\nchy at which technological advancements will be made\nare important to consider on the front-end, as this will\nimpact the needed hardware and user-interface. Further,\nin targeting the end-user population early in the develop\nment phases of a technology-based intervention, the\nhealth care staff, be they doctors, nurses, or community\nhealth workers, can be made a central part of the planning\nand implementation teams. If the end-users do not per\nceive a need or value to a new piece of technology, the\noverall success of implementing that technology will\nlikely be low.\nAs Malkin [25-27] points out, problems such as rising\ncosts of medical equipment, embedded service contracts,\nlack of spare parts, lack of required consumables, lack of\nhttp://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/content/7/1/18\nreliable power and water, lack of public infrastructure\nsuch as roads, and lack of technical expertise, plague\nhealth care technology in the developing world. While\npoor infrastructure, such as the telecommunications and\nelectricity grid, should not be seen as justification for rel\negating improvements in health care technology to the\nfuture, the realities of existing capacities must be taken\ninto account. For example, many developing countries\nhave far more reliable wireless than traditional telecom\nmunications systems [49], and technological advance\nments should focus on those existing strengths.\nInformation and communications technology (ICT) is\none area in which developing countries have made signif\nicant advancements, and it has been touted as a cost-effec\ntive mechanism for delivering health care information in\ndeveloping countries [50]. In particular, ICT can be lever\naged to address the dearth of trained personnel, by both\ninterpreting medical data and facilitating training. With a\ncontinually growing rate of over 80% of the world's pop\nulation living in range of a cellphone tower, telemedicine\napplications for automated or remote analysis (such as X-\nray reading [51]) are becoming increasingly attractive.\nIn order to illustrate the above points, examples of suc\ncessful applications of ICT to health care for under-served\npopulations in Peru and Haiti are described in the follow\ning section.\nThe PIH Projects in Peru and Haiti: Health ICT\nexamples in middle and low income countries\nIn 1996 Partners In Health (PIH), with their Peruvian sis\nter organization, Socios En Salud (SES) and the Peruvian\nMinistry of Health, started a community-based treatment\nprogram for drug-resistant tuberculosis in the slums of\nLima, Peru. Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is\ndefined as TB resistant to isoniazid and rifampin, the two\nmost efficacious anti-tuberculous drugs. At that time the\nfew models for treatment of MDR-TB were costly and were\ncentered around referral hospitals. Reported rates of suc\ncess in middle-income countries and regions ranged from\nless than 60% in Indonesia and Taiwan [52,53] to just\nover 80% in Hong Kong, Korea, and Turkey [54-57]. PIH\nand SES created a community-based project to treat MDR\nTB in a resource-poor setting. This new project termed\n\"DOTS-Plus\" project built on top of the well-established\nPeruvian\nDirectly\nObserved\nTherapy-Short\nCourse\n(DOTS) program and treated patients with long-standing\ndisease due to highly resistant strains of TB.\nReported cure rates in this community-based, ambulatory\nprogram were as high as any reported in a hospital setting\nto date [7]. Unlike other cohorts, which had high default\nrates, all patients in the PIH/SES cohort received directly\nobserved therapy. Adverse effects, moreover, were care\nfully managed to ensure completion of treatment. Mitnick\nPage 4 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n\nBioMedical Engineering OnLine 2008, 7:18\net al. [7] state that in 1997 \"mean treatment costs were\nUS$15,681 per patient, these costs were low at that time -\napproximately 10% of the costs for hospitalized patients\n[58,59] - but well beyond the reach of most national\ntuberculosis programs.\" Since then advocacy work and\npooled procurement have made second-line anti-tubercu\nlous drugs available to countries and programs needing\nthem. Through negotiations with the research-based and\ngeneric pharmaceutical industries, the cost of drugs for\nmulti-drug-resistant TB was reduced by up to 98% [60]. By\nestablishing a long-term collaboration and moving treat\nment into the community, PIH was able to provide high-\nquality care, lower costs, reduce the risk of nosocomial\nspread of MDR-TB [61-64], and provide additional, indi\nvidualized services that patients in low-resource areas may\nneed. Further, this community-based network can be\nstrengthened to provide primary care [65] and be a source\nof data for further interventions.\nThe Partners In Health Electronic Medical Record (PIH\nEMR) [17], implemented in 2001, was developed to sup\nport the two-year MDR-TB treatment regimen for the\ncohort described above. The PIH-EMR is an example of a\nweb-based EMR based on open-source technology and\nbacked by an Oracle database. The system is viewable in\nboth English and Spanish and currently has over 29,000\npatients, 7,600 of which have received treatment. The\nPIH-EMR includes a clinical record with initial history,\nphysical examination, laboratory results and medications\non all patients receiving individualized treatment for\nMDR-TB. The custom medication order entry system pro\nvides advice on potential problems and feedback to the\nclinical personnel. There is an extensive suite of web-\nbased analysis tools for reporting and outcome monitor\ning [17]. Analysis tools are used to assess drug require\nments based on the medications prescribed and perform\noperation research. It is also linked to a pharmacy inven\ntory and dispensing system. Evaluations of modules of\nthis system have shown that the medication order entry\nsystem produced significantly fewer errors than the previ\nous paper and spreadsheet approach [15]. Drug usage pre\ndiction tools have been shown to match the usage data in\nthe pharmacy to within 3% [16] and are used routinely is\ndrug ordering. Further modules have been added to the\nPIH-EMR to collect and communicate TB laboratory data.\nA personal digital assistant (PDA)-based system to collect\nTB lab data from laboratories and health centers without\ninternet was shown to reduce processing delays from 30 to\n8 days, reduce errors by 60%, and to be preferred by users\n[66].\nThe PIH-EMR has recently been adopted by the Peruvian\nNational Tuberculosis Program for its drug-resistant TB\ntreatment program, and there are plans to expand its use\nto the entire TB program in Peru. The PIH-EMR is also\nhttp://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/content/7/1/18\nused to create monthly reports for the Global Fund and\nthe Health Ministry. This experience demonstrates that\nthese types of systems are feasible to implement in\nresource-poor settings. Another web-based module\ntermed e-Chasqui has been designed and implemented to\nimprove the timeliness and quality of laboratory data\n[28]. In Peru, the e-Chasqui system has been deployed in\nthe national TB laboratory, two regional laboratories, and\n24 pilot health centers. Since its full implementation in\nMarch 2006, over 70,000 TB laboratory tests have been\nentered into the system with over 99% of them viewed\nonline by the health centers. In total, e-Chasqui serves a\nnetwork of institutions providing medical care for over\n3.1 million people at a cost of approximately US$0.53 per\nsample, the annual total cost is equivalent to 1% of the\nNational Peruvian TB program's 2006 budget.\nSince 1999, PIH has run a community-based HIV treat\nment program in Haiti with its sister organization, Zanmi\nLasante, expanding to nine public health clinics in an area\nwith virtually no roads, electricity or telephone service. In\nthese clinics, 'Directly Observed Therapy with Highly\nActive Antiretroviral Therapy' (DOT-HAART) for HIV is\nmodeled on successful tuberculosis control efforts like the\none described previously. Each HIV patient has a commu\nnity-health worker who observes ingestion of pills,\nresponds to patient and family concerns, and offers moral\nsupport. Social support - including assistance with chil\ndren's school fees - is included in services offered.\nMonthly meetings, in which patients discuss their illness\nand other concerns, are notable for high attendance\n[4,67]. In 2006 over 8,000 HIV-positive persons, 2,300 of\nwhom are on antiretroviral therapy (ART), are now fol\nlowed [68]. Adherence to HAART was very high, and clin\nical outcomes were excellent: all patients responded with\nweight gain and improved functional capacity, and fewer\nthan 5% required medication changes due to side effects\n[69]. As elsewhere, patients receiving HAART are far less\nlikely to require admission to hospital than are patients\nwith untreated HIV disease [70].\nThe HIV-EMR, an open source web-based system [71],\nwas based on the PIH-EMR. Satellite-based internet access\nat each site provides access to the system; however, due to\nthe inconsistent power and internet available, an addi\ntional offline client for data entry and review was imple\nmented [72]. The HIV-EMR system has been implemented\nin all sites and currently has over 12,000 patients; 3,051\nof which are receiving ART. The system records clinical\ndata including history, physical examination, social cir\ncumstances and treatment prescribed. Decision support\ntools provide allergy and drug interaction warnings and\ngenerate warning emails about low CD4 counts. (The\nlower your CD4 count, the greater the chances of poten\ntially fatal infections.) Staff also keep paper records, but\nPage 5 of 8\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n\nBioMedical Engineering OnLine 2008, 7:18\nthey can use the EMR to check for up to date lab results\nand drug regimen data and monitor patients' follow-up\nstatus. A suite of reporting tools allow staff to create key\nreports, such as for the U.S. President's Emergency Plan\nfor AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and automatically generate the\nreports monthly. Data quality is backed by a monthly\nchecklist of patients and their drug regimens and treat\nment status that is filled out by the pharmacy and nursing\nstaff and used to update and cross-check the EMR. There is\nalso a full pharmacy inventory system and tools for drug\nregimen analysis. The inventory system allows pharmacy\nstaff at all clinics to enter stock levels and request drugs\nand track shipments. This system is used to track 450\nproducts supporting care for 1.78 million patient visits\nannually. Over the last year drug stockouts have fallen\nfrom 2.6% to 1.1% and 97% of stock requests delivered\nwere shipped within 1 day [73]. EMR systems have been\nshown to provide a better one-year estimate for medica\ntion ordering and therefore reduce costs in having stock-\nouts or more expensive, local emergency purchases com\npared to the current method of ordering based on the last\nyear's estimates [74,75].\nSummary\nAmong the significant barriers to the provision of health\ncare in developing countries, detailed information con\ncerning disease incidence, health practices and available\nresources (such as drugs for treatment) are some of the\nmost important. Without detailed information concern\ning the response to health programs, it is impossible to\nevaluate the efficacy of a particular program and, hence,\neffectively allocate funding and resources. Although\npaper-based systems can provide a partial solution, infor\nmation transmission is slow and prone to errors. Further\nmore, aggregation of data is challenging as patient\nnumbers rise into the hundreds [19], and near impossible\nwith thousands of patients. It is also difficult to impose\nconsistent reporting indicators.\nThe systems described above illustrate the advantages of\nimplementing healthcare technologies within larger col\nlaborations that improve the overall public health infra\nstructure. One key aspect of the technologies employed in\nthese projects is the use of open standards and open-\nsource development in a collaborative environment.\nThe cases described in this article also demonstrate the\nneed for community data collection, and feasibility of\nusing ICT to enable data collection, and improve informa\ntion flow in developing countries. Without such\napproaches, interventions may exacerbate inequalities\nwithin countries with weak infrastructure and ingrained\nsocial disparities. However, these systems will only work\nwell with carefully designed forms and interfaces, and\nexcellent data management. Furthermore, EMRs can pro\nhttp://www.biomedical-engineering-online.com/content/7/1/18\nvide a foundational technology that allows for the adop\ntion and evaluation of other health care technologies,\nsuch as drug ordering, medical devices, and longitudinal\npatient follow-ups. Moreover, the projects described\nabove illustrate that the creation of long-term relation\nships to build infrastructure and solving systemic prob\nlems to provide health care can be beneficial to both the\npatients and the projects involved.\nAbbreviations\nAIDS: Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome; ART:\nAntiretroviral Therapy; BSD: Berkeley Software Distribu\ntion; CEN: Comite Europeen de Normalisation; CD4:\nCluster of Differentiation 4; DOTS: Directly Observed\nTherapy-Short course; DOT-HAART: Directly Observed\nTherapy with Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy; EHR:\nElectronic Health Record; EMR: Electronic Medical\nRecord; GEHR: Good Electronic Health Record; HIV:\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus; HL7: Health Level 7;\nICT: Information and Communications Technology;\nICT4D: Information and Communications Technology\nfor Development; LGPL: Lesser GNU Public License;\nMDR-TB: Multi-Drug Resistant Tuberculosis; MRS: Medi\ncal Record System; OECD: Organization for Economic\nCo-operation and Development; PDA: Personal Digital\nAssistant; PEPFAR: President's Emergency Plan for AIDS\nRelief; PIH: Partners In Health; PIH-EMR: Partners In\nHealth Electronic Medical Record; SES: Socios En Salud;\nTB: Tuberculosis; UMLS: Unified Medical Language Sys\ntem; VHA: Veterans Health Administration; WHO: World\nHealth Organization.\nCompeting interests\nThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\nAuthors' contributions\nGDC drafted the editorial and provided the final editing,\nRHC contributed material and references concerning\nanthropology and public health statistics as well as edito\nrial assistance, JAB and HSFF made significant changes\nand provided material and references concerning PIH\nresearch in Haiti and Peru.

The objective of this paper is to describe an electronic\nlaboratory information system implemented to alleviate these problems and its expanding use by the Peruvian public sector, as\nwell as examine the broader issues of implementing such systems in resource-poor settings.\nMethods: A web-based laboratory information system \"e-Chasqui\" has been designed and implemented in Peru to improve the\ntimeliness and quality of laboratory data. It was deployed in the national TB laboratory, two regional laboratories and twelve\npilot health centres. Using needs assessment and workflow analysis tools, e-Chasqui was designed to provide for improved\npatient care, increased quality control, and more efficient laboratory monitoring and reporting.\nResults: Since its full implementation in March 2006, 29,944 smear microscopy, 31,797 culture and 7,675 drug susceptibility\ntest results have been entered. Over 99% of these results have been viewed online by the health centres. High user satisfaction\nand heavy use have led to the expansion of e-Chasqui to additional institutions. In total, e-Chasqui will serve a network of\ninstitutions providing medical care for over 3.1 million people. The cost to maintain this system is approximately US$0.53 per\nsample or 1% of the National Peruvian TB program's 2006 budget.\nConclusion: Electronic laboratory information systems have a large potential to improve patient care and public health\nmonitoring in resource-poor settings. Some of the challenges faced in these settings, such as lack of trained personnel, limited\ntransportation, and large coverage areas, are obstacles that a well-designed system can overcome. e-Chasqui has the potential\nto provide a national TB laboratory network in Peru. Furthermore, the core functionality of e-Chasqui as been implemented in\nthe open source medical record system OpenMRS http://www.openmrs.org\nPublished: 28 October 2007\nReceived: 25 June 2007\nAccepted: 28 October 2007\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2007, 7:33\ndoi:10.1186/1472-6947-7-33\nThis article is available from: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/7/33\n(c) 2007 Blaya et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.\nThis is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0\nfor other countries to use.\n),\nwhich permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.\n\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2007, 7:33\nBackground\nTuberculosis (TB) is a chronic infectious disease that kills\nover 2 million people per year in the developing world. TB\ncan typically be diagnosed rapidly by sputum microscopy\nat a local health facility, but diagnosis of multi-drug resist\nant TB (MDR-TB) - defined as TB strains resistant to at\nleast isoniazid and rifampin - requires a drug susceptibil\nity test (DST) which is usually performed at a regional,\nnational or even supranational level. The emergence of\nextensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) height\nens the urgency of prompt diagnosis of drug resistance to\ncurb the excessive mortality and ongoing transmission\nassociated with highly resistant strains [1]. Communica\ntion of DST results between central and local laboratories\nand clinical facilities can be problematic and results can\ntake several months [2] to get to their destination or never\narrive [3], especially in high-burden countries with lim\nited infrastructure. Prompt treatment with individualized\ndrug regimens based on DST improves patient outcomes\n[4] and reduces the risk of amplification of drug resistance\nand ongoing transmission [5,6]. As Raviglione and Smith\ncomment in a recent editorial, \"information is essential to\nbuild a response [to drug-resistant diseases], and only\ncomputerized information systems allow sufficiently\nrapid exchange of information within and between coun\ntries[7].\"\nLaboratory Information Systems\nLaboratory information systems in developed countries\nhave been shown to decrease turn-around-times (TAT) of\nlaboratory results [8-10], reduce redundancy in resource\nutilization [9,11,12], and provide faster and more com\nplete notification for public health purposes [13-15].\nShorter TATs have been associated with decreased treat\nment time, mortality, morbidity, and length of hospital\nstay [16,17]. We are aware of the use of laboratory systems\nin the central laboratories in a few developing countries\nsuch as Peru and Russia. However, to our knowledge,\nthere are no reports of the use of these systems to link lab\noratories to clinical settings.\nThere are potentially greater benefits of using clinical\ninformation systems in locations with limited infrastruc\nture where other methods of communications are more\ncostly. However, though they can provide many benefits,\nthese systems are difficult to implement. In developed\ncountries, it is estimated that up to 60% of all information\ntechnology implementations in health care fail [18].\nAmong the many challenges that need to be surpassed are\nover-burdened laboratory and clinical personnel, fre\nquent staff rotation, limited computer and internet access,\nand frequent changes in administrations and policies.\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/7/33\nCreating a Peruvian National Laboratory Network\nThe implementation of decentralized, rapid DST is under\nway as part of nationwide efforts to scale up services for\ndetection and treatment of MDR-TB and XDR-TB by the\nPeruvian Ministry of Health [19]. Whereas initially only\nthe Peruvian National Reference Laboratory (NRL) per\nformed DST, the capacity of the regional laboratories has\nexpanded to include rapid and conventional first-line\nDSTs. The typical flow of a suspected TB patient's sputum\nsample from the initial treatment site through the labora\ntory network is depicted in Figure 1. Each test result is\ncommunicated serially, and in each step, there are delays\nand the potential to lose the result.\nA study of TATs for cultures and DSTs within the Peruvian\npublic health system suggests that patients could still\nexperience risky delays despite availability of decentral\nized, rapid DST unless programmatic aspects are also\naddressed [2]. In addition to reducing communication\ndelays, minimizing lost and erroneous results is essential\nfor reducing morbidity in these high-risk patients. To\nimprove these aspects, we developed and implemented\nthe laboratory information system described herein.\nThis paper describes the design and implementation of a\nweb-based TB laboratory information system to commu\nnicate data between a national laboratory, two regional\nlaboratories, and 12 health centres (HC) in Lima, Peru.\nThis system was designed to support a national TB labora\ntory network connecting all participating institutions. We\nthen describe the expansion of the system at the request of\nthe public administration. Finally, we examine broader\nissues of implementing these types of systems in resource-\npoor settings including costs and sustainability.\nMethods\nNeeds Assessment\nThe first step in creating the laboratory information sys\ntem was to conduct a needs assessment of the major stake\nholders: the personnel in the HCs, regional, and national\nlaboratories. After working with the director, laboratory\ntechnician and data entry staff in the participating labora\ntories and the TB clinician, nurse and local laboratory\ntechnician in several key HCs, a list of information\nrequirements was created, shown in Table 1. While most\nrequirements were identified during this initial period,\nothers emerged during the implementation process.\nIntegration into Laboratory Workflow\nThe laboratory information system needed to be inte\ngrated within the workflow of the busy regional and cen\ntral laboratories. We performed a thorough workflow\nanalysis of each laboratory's systems of information, each\nstaff's responsibilities, quality control, and tests per\nformed, and designed the system to follow the current\nPage 2 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n\nTuberculosis Laboratory Structure/Workflow in Lima and Locations of e-Chasqui Implementation\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2007, 7:33\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/7/33\nFigure 1\nTuberculosis Laboratory Structure/Workflow in Lima and Locations of e-Chasqui Implementation.\nworkflow of intake, processing, and reporting. However,\nthe integration of the information system still required\nworkflow adjustments to incorporate data entry, digital\nverification, and printing of results from the system. This\nwas done through iterative discussions with the labora\ntory directors followed by an hour-long training session\nfor all laboratory personnel. These changes in workflow,\nhowever, did not result in increased time demands;\ninstead the revised system resulted in greater efficiency for\nmost laboratory personnel, since the database (with relia\nble back-up) obviated the need to photocopy and main\ntain physical copies of all results at the laboratory.\nFinally, the laboratory information system had to inte\ngrate with current laboratory reporting systems being\nused. During the implementation of e-Chasqui the NRL\nmoved from using the PHLIS laboratory reporting system\n[20], to an in-house developed laboratory management\nsystem. To communicate data between these systems, a\ntool was created to manually export all results; we are cur\nrently defining other inter-system communication meth\nods.\nSystem Design\nThe electronic laboratory information system, called e-\nChasqui, supports the decentralized entry and viewing of\nbacteriological tests (smear microscopy, cultures, species\nidentification, and DSTs). The Chasquis were agile and\nhighly-trained runners that delivered messages, royal del\nicacies and other objects throughout the Inca Empire and\nare a source of pride in Peru. In addition, it includes appli\ncations to assess quality control, generate aggregate\nreports, notify health centres of new results or contami\nnated samples, and track both enrolled patients and the\nstatus of pending laboratory tests. e-Chasqui extends the\nweb-based TB electronic medical record system, PIH\nEMR, that has been in use in Peru since 2001 [21,22]. To\nprotect patient's confidentiality, e-Chasqui incorporated\nPage 3 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2007, 7:33\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/7/33\nTable 1: Needs Assessment of Health Centres and Laboratories\nHealth Centres\nAll information displayed to mirror paper forms\nFind patient by name despite constant misspellings\nFast access despite low bandwidth\nEasily access patient's individual result and history of all results\nFor a sample view all tests performed and date when sample was taken\nView all recent results by HC\nTrack all tests pending by HC\nAccess information on samples collected in other institutions (e.g. while hospitalized, prior to transfer to their HC)\nEmail notification of new test results\nPrint out a test result in the official MINSA format\nDisplay trend in DST requests by HC\nShow MDR-TB patients not appropriate treatment\nCurrent patients failing treatment\nAccess latest information on evidence-based TB treatment\nLaboratories\nIntegrate into laboratory workflow with minimal disturbance or increased work\nSearch for sample by ID number\nIndividual results printed in current paper form\nAggregate reporting for all tests entered\nAbility to view all culture and DST results reported within an arbitrary time period\nImprove quality control of test results\nAbility to modify or \"grow\" system with continual requirements\nCompatibility with existing computerized information systems\nextensive encryption and web security features for medical\nrecords of the PIH-EMR [23]. Furthermore, all users sign a\nconfidentiality agreement before being given access.\nWe worked with the national and regional district and\nlaboratory directors to define the access profiles for the\ndifferent types of users. Clinical personnel have individual\naccess to all patients under their responsibility e.g. single\nHC, multiple HCs, or a full district. Examples of clinical\npersonnel include HC staff, the regional TB program\ndirector, and the regional treatment approval committees,\ncomposed of pulmonologists and clinicians. Laboratory\npersonnel have both an individual and aggregate view of\nlaboratory test results. Defining the types of access, getting\nall stakeholders to agree, and building the flexibility into\nthe system was one of the most difficult tasks in building\ne-Chasqui.\nThe ultimate goal of the system is for all laboratories,\nincluding those at HCs, to enter tests they've performed\nand use the system to order further tests. However, in the\ninitial phase all data was entered at the NRL and regional\nlaboratories with \"read-only\" access provided to HCs.\nTherefore when the first e-Chasqui laboratory receives a\nsample, they enter all previous test results performed on\nthat sample.\nPatient Care\nThe core of the e-Chasqui interface is a single patient page\ncontaining the history of all tests performed for the\npatient on a left sidebar, and the details for any single\nsample on the main part of the page (Figure 2). For a sin\ngle sample, tests can be performed by up to four different\nlaboratories. All test results are displayed in this single\npage to give the full history of the sample. This novel\ntracking ability is a useful addition; prior to e-Chasqui's\nimplementation, laboratory and clinical personnel sys\ntems lacked the test request date or the smear or culture\ndata when they received a DST result. The system uses a\nflexible search algorithm by either the patient's names\n(including partial names) or by any of the sample's test\nidentification numbers. This patient page, like all others,\ncontains only text and uses optimized SQL queries to load\nquickly even in areas with low bandwidth.\nFrom this page, the user can select which tests to print in\nthe official report format. Though each HC can print the\nreport immediately after laboratory verification, each lab\noratory also prints a copy and sends this stamped \"offi\ncial\" report to the HC for their paper records. Due to the\nhigh load of TB patients, the HC personnel requested the\nability to view their latest results on a single page and track\nthe status of all their samples being processed. Tools were\ndesigned to meet these requirements. Finally, all HC users\nreceive nightly email notifications for new test results on\npatients attending their HC.\nLaboratory Quality Control\nThe laboratory personnel described long-standing prob\nlems with ensuring the timeliness of reporting results.\nSince a culture or DST result takes 20 to 60 days to be read,\nsome tests \"fell through the cracks\" and were not read, or\nPage 4 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n\ne-Chasqui main patient page\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2007, 7:33\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/7/33\nFigure 2\ne-Chasqui main patient page. This page shows the patient's full bacteriological history on the left sidebar and with bolded\nsample date for the sample whose results were being displayed on main part of page.\nwere read late. Furthermore, they also requested ways to\nensure all results had been entered, to minimize duplicate\ntests, and to monitor the contamination rate. Therefore,\nthe system was expanded to incorporate quality control\ntools to remind personnel to read samples on a regular\nbasis, flag duplicate or missing results, and report contam\nination rates. These tools are usually automatically updat\ning tables or lists of tests that show the appropriate\ninformation.\nLaboratory Monitoring/Reporting\nAn initial reporting tool was created for the regional labo\nratories to view all results. Further monitoring and report\ning tools were created as the needs arose throughout the\nimplementation process. They can be seen in Table 2.\nPage 5 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2007, 7:33\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/7/33\nTable 2: Reports generated by e-Chasqui\nReport\nInformed\nPurpose\nType of Access\nFrequency of e-Chasqui access by HC personnel\nRegional laboratory and\nEncourage frequent utilization of IS\nMonthly report prepared\nTB director\nto access real-time laboratory data by data administrator\nNumber of laboratory results entered at regional\nRegional laboratory and\nIdentify delays in data entry\nMonthly report prepared\nlaboratory\nTB director\nby data administrator\nNumber of laboratory results verified and released to\nRegional laboratory and\nIdentify delays in verification\nMonthly report prepared\nproviders\nTB director\nby data administrator\nDST results for any specified period grouped by\nRegional and INS\nReport and identify trends in\nConstant access**\nevery variable in request form\nlaboratory director\nlaboratory performance\nCulture results for any specified period grouped by\nRegional and INS\nReport and identify trends in\nConstant access**\nevery variable in request form\nlaboratory director\nlaboratory performance\nIndividuals with a positive culture for any specified\nRegional and INS\nReport to regional TB program\nConstant access**\ndate\nlaboratory director\n**Constant access means that the laboratory users could view this information in the system at any time. Some reports let the user specify the start\nand end dates.\nImplementation\nThough described separately from the needs assessment\nand system design, the deployment of e-Chasqui in the\nlaboratories and HCs was complementary and overlapped\nas the use and functionality of e-Chasqui grew.\nInformation Technology Assessment\nThe initial step of implementation consisted of an assess\nment of the information technology status at each HC and\nlaboratory, performed by the regional health districts, and\nincluded data such as the number and condition of com\nputers in each HC, physical security, and internet access.\nThe assessment identified key deficits, and we were able to\ncoordinate with each health district to perform correc\ntions such as donating or fixing computers and providing\nor improving internet access.\nLaboratories\nThe commitment of the health districts was demonstrated\nby providing a part-time data entry person specifically for\ne-Chasqui. We trained all laboratory staff in the workflow\nchanges and in the use of e-Chasqui during a single 1\nhour group training session. We also had individualized\nsessions for each user since each had different responsibil\nities, on average lasting approximately 1.5 hours. After\nseveral months of use, two of the three laboratories\nrequested that the technicians also have e-Chasqui access.\nFor data entry several simple design tools were imple\nmented and found to be valuable. First, for ease of data\nentry each data field can be accessed not only by clicking\non the field with the mouse, but also by sequential tab\nbing through the page. Second, the main patient page was\nidentical to the test request form from which the data\nentry occurred. To avoid duplicate patients when a new\npatient is being created, e-Chasqui searches for patients\nwith similar names, and if any are found a warning is dis\nplayed where the user can click on one of the existing\npatient names or click the \"Create New Patient\" button.\nAlso, a tool to merge patient records was created to handle\nduplicates. Duplicate sample records are handled using\ndata quality tools, explained previously in the Laboratory\nQuality Control section\nThe system had to be continually expanded and adapted\nto the needs encountered during the pilot phase. During\nthe first eight months after implementation, functionality\nto generate lists of reported DSTs and the quality control\ntools were created. In the following 3 months, we added\npages for the HC users to view the tests currently being\nprocessed and a consolidated view of the last 3 weeks of\nresults. In Sept. 2006, 11 months after initial implemen\ntation, the NRL began to use this system required changes\nto accommodate its specific workflow. At the same time\nwe modified the system, at HC users' request, to send only\none email at night if results had been verified that day, as\nopposed to an email for every result verified.\nHealth Centres\nOnce a HC had a computer with internet access that could\nbe used by the TB personnel, all users were trained in a\nsingle 1-hour session in computer use, confidentiality\nprocedures, and use of e-Chasqui. The e-Chasqui data\nadministrator then performed follow-ups every third\nweek. In most HCs, we identified at least one \"champion\"\nwho uses the system frequently. However, rarely did we\nfind this champion promoting the system to others.\nThroughout the implementation, we had to troubleshoot\nproblems. Most of the problems were administrative or\nhardware related such as having to create a new windows\nXP user, ensuring that HC users were viewing their results\nin e-Chasqui in a timely fashion, replacing a stolen com\nputer, and providing six web access points to TB programs\nwithin HCs that lacked computer access (Baobab Health\nPartnership) [24].\nPage 6 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n\nAverage monthly number of pages viewed by health centres (HC)\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2007, 7:33\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/7/33\nResults\nThe needs assessment and workflow analysis began in\nJune 2005, with the first user testing in July 2005, January\n2006, and May 2006, for each of the two regional and the\nnational laboratories, respectively. Full implementation\noccurred in March 2006, August 2006, and September\n2006, respectively.\nSystem Usage\nOur system has been successfully integrated into program\noperations. Since its initial implementation, 29,994\nsmear microscopy, 31,797 culture and 7,675 DST results\nhave been entered. In 2006, 99.5% of all DST results and\n98.8% of all culture results for the 12 pilot HCs were\nviewed online. The average number of pages viewed by\nthe HCs in each of the two health districts (Lima Ciudad,\nLima Este) can be seen in Figure 3. The large increase in\npages viewed in August 2006 occurred because e-Chasqui\nwas fully implemented in both the Lima Este regional lab\noratory and the NRL.\nThis is an online transaction processing system and since\nit is used in sites with low to medium internet bandwidth,\nthis is a major factor in its performance. Due to e-\nChasqui's simple, text-based design all sites can use it dur\ning routine clinical and laboratory work. In 2006, the sys\ntem performed on average 1865 transactions per day\nincluding page views, data entry, and analysis. In 2007, it\nhas increased to 4501 daily transaction and the system's\nperformance has not been appreciably affected. Feedback\nfrom users has been positive. This feedback has been in\nthe form of conversations by the research staff with the\nclinical and laboratory personnel, increased usage of the\nsystem by intervention sites, and requests for expansion of\nthe use of the system by the district and laboratory admin\nistrators. Importantly, we have been careful to respond to\ncritical comments and suggestions to enhance the system\nand maintain user \"buy-in.\" A strong indicator of the sys\ntem's utility is that district administrators have requested\nexpansion of the system to additional institutions. In\nresponse, we are expanding access to three laboratories, 2\nhospitals and 11 HCs that administrate 47 other health\ncentres. In total, e-Chasqui will serve a network of institu\ntions providing medical care for over 3.1 million people.\nSystem Costs\nIn quantifying the costs of designing and implementing\nthis web-based system in Peru, we have found the annual\nrecurring cost to be US$34,738 total or US$0.53 per sam\nple entered. More details can be found in Table 3. This fig-\nFigure 3\nAverage monthly number of pages viewed by health centres (HC).

For infrastructure, the objective is to have every health institution with a computer, printer and intermittent, if\nnot constant, internet connection. System advocacy has consisted of meetings and discussions, usually with national or regional administrators, to\ndiscuss the system's potential benefits, provide updates on its status, and train users on the system's abilities since this was the first time a web-\nbased clinical system had been implemented. The costs incurred by a new program implementing e-Chasqui should be reduced as they will not\ninclude system development. All costs are in 2007 U.S. Dollars Unless explicitly stated all staff are US based\nure includes the cost of full internet access to all e-Chasqui\nwith a local salary, the annual recurring cost reflects the\ninstitutions and a US based system manager.

For comparison,\nhealth register, we feel the system should incur 50% of the\nthe e-Chasqui health districts had 1103 MDR-TB patients\ninternet cost. Also, if the system manager was Peruvian\non standardized or individualized treatment in 2006. The\nPage 8 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2007, 7:33\nannual cost of these treatments are approximately\nUS$2,900 and US$3,000, respectively [25]. Another com\nparison is that these health districts accounted for 53% of\nTB and MDR-TB patients in a national program whose\n2006 budget was close to US$10 million [26]. In either\ncase, this system to communicate all vital laboratory data\nfor TB and MDR-TB treatment accounted for approxi\nmately 1% of the budget for those districts.\nDiscussion\nChallenges and Obstacles\nCreating a system with enough flexibility to meet all stakeholders'\nneeds that arise during implementation\nThough e-Chasqui has focused functionality, the need to\ncreate many types of users and to define methods of com\nmunication between institutions took much work and\ntime. There were two main reasons for this. First, the inex\nperience in implementing clinical information systems\namong stakeholders meant much learning about this\ntopic had to take place. As a result, the technical require\nments of e-Chasqui were constantly revised. For example,\nsome stakeholders were unfamiliar with the concept that\ndifferent users see information in specific manner such as\nindividual or aggregate views. Therefore some exhibited\ninitial scepticism about the system's ability to maintain\ninformation confidential. Second, defining appropriate\nuser accesses to balance patient confidentiality with users'\nrequest for information. Again due to e-Chasqui's novelty,\nboth the developers and the institutions have had to learn\nwhat the appropriate user permissions were. Here the\nweb-based architecture allows e-Chasqui to track all users'\nactions. This capability was highly valued by all stake\nholders since many of them asked about data confidenti\nality and security.\nMaintaining both high data quality and timeliness with limited staff\nThe balance between opportune entry of results and elec\ntronic verification with high data quality continues to be\na problem. The mean number of days between a DST\nresult being read, its entry, and verification is 5.8. Though\nwe believe that the additional step of result verification\nensures higher data quality, we are still working to mini\nmize these delays. On the other hand, the average number\nof days from laboratory verification to the HC personnel\nviewing their result in e-Chasqui is 2.2 which shows their\ninterest in updated results.\nStrengthening public infrastructure\nTo ensure e-Chasqui had lasting impact on patient care, it\nwas necessary to integrate this system within the public\nhealth structure. Though this can mean additional work in\nterms of agreements with the different national and\nregional institutions, as well as providing additional serv\nices, the long lasting benefits, such as sustainability and\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/7/33\nimplementation at a national level, usually outweigh this\nadditional work.\nLessons learned\nTB programs trying to improve communications, moni\ntoring, and patient care by implementing electronic infor\nmation systems face a task that can sometimes seem\noverwhelming. We have learned several lessons from our\nexperience developing a nation-wide electronic laboratory\ninformation system in Peru.\nAll important stakeholders must contribute to the design and\nimplementation\nThis is the only way to ensure the system addresses the\nactual user needs and to have user appropriation. To iden\ntify key system attributes during the design, medical and\nlaboratory personnel must be involved from the begin\nning. Furthermore, developers must create a system easily\nintegrated into the existing workflow with minimal dis\nruption and sufficient advantages to gain \"buy-in\" such as\neasy usage for people with little computer experience.\nLastly, branding the system appropriately, perhaps with a\nfamiliar name, makes it more recognizable. During the\nsystem's implementation, users must be constantly asked\nif they have questions or problems and their suggestions\nfor fixing them. Problems that are outside the system's\nscope, such as not having access to a computer with inter\nnet, personal conflicts with other personnel who would\nlike internet access, or equipment failures, should be\naddressed with administrative personnel.\nPolitical support is integral to the system's dissemination\nUnless there is will from the administration to implement\nan electronic information system, promote its use, and\nallocate resources to maintain it, there is little chance of\nsuccess. This system was implemented as part of a scale up\nstrategy between the National Tuberculosis Program and\nNRL to expand the laboratory network. Political support\nin this case was demonstrated by the support of the\nregional health administration and by laboratories pro\nviding data entry staff.\nProvide adequate training in the system's use and benefits\nTraining should be focused on the benefits that it provides\nto the users. In Peru, most previous health information\nsystems have required HC personnel to enter data for\nreporting purposes without receiving any feedback. While\nimplementing e-Chasqui, we saw reticent users become\nenthusiastic when they realized the system would provide\nthem with useful information. Training must also be pro\nvided continually, and the system's use monitored to\nensure it continues to meet user's needs.\nPage 9 of 11\n(page number not for citation purposes)\n\nBMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making 2007, 7:33\nEnsure the system's sustainability\nSustainability in our experience is maintained by generat\ning user confidence in the system's quality and usability,\ncreating a flexible system able to adapt to changes within\nthe public system, and providing evidence of system ben\nefits. To have user confidence, the system must actually\nsave time and be perceived as a consistently useful tool after\nthe initial novelty has worn off. Three main factors to pro\nmote sustainability include (1) providing and maintain\ning a functional internet access point at their HC, (2)\nensuring the quality and promptness of data, and (3) pro\nviding support to all users. Support to all users usually\ntook the form of technical assistance at the laboratories\nand up-to-date results to HCs.\nImplement the system as part of a larger structural improvement\nWe believe that the implementation of an information\nsystem is enhanced if it is an integral part of larger\nimprovements in the clinical or laboratory infrastructure.\nThat way the system can not only help improve commu\nnication but also be part of a more general improvement\nin workflow. In the case of e-Chasqui, it was incorporated\ninto national project to decentralize DSTs.\nConclusion\nElectronic laboratory information systems have much\npotential to improve patient care and public health mon\nitoring in resource-poor settings. Some of the challenges\ndescribed, such as lack of trained personnel, limited trans\nportation, and large coverage areas, are obstacles that a\nwell-designed information system can overcome. How\never, creating well-designed information systems is a diffi\ncult task necessitating appropriate resources, expertise and\ntime to be successful.\nThe purpose of this paper is to pass on our experience of\ncritical design issues and required capabilities to make\nsimilar systems work on-site. Though other projects will\nneed to design and rollout laboratory information sys\ntems, we hope to make the process less onerous next time\naround.\ne-Chasqui has the potential for creating a national TB lab\noratory network in Peru to facilitate the communication\nand analysis of all bacteriological results country-wide.\nWe have already begun to see additional benefits to this\nsystem such as having the test always available during\nclinical decision making, reducing duplicate tests per\nformed, and reducing the time and money spent by staff\nchecking the status of their samples. Studies have been ini\ntiated to quantify these benefits. We are also conducting a\nprospective and retrospective evaluation study to measure\ne-Chasqui's effect on reducing mean delays, \"lost\" results\nwith excessive delays, and errors of laboratory reporting.\nFurthermore, this same system or one similar could more\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6947/7/33\neasily be implemented in other countries facing similar\nproblems of test tracking. In our efforts to make these sys\ntems available, we are implementing the core functional\nity of e-Chasqui as a module in the OpenMRS system\n[27,28]. OpenMRS is a general purpose medical record\nsystem architecture we have developed with colleagues in\nthe US and Africa to support TB and HIV treatment pro\ngrams. OpenMRS is being rolled out in eight coun\ntries[29] with support from the US Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention and the World Health Organiza\ntion. At least two of these countries will use the e-Chasqui\ncomponent.\nCompeting interests\nThe author(s) declare that they have no competing inter\nests.\nAuthors' contributions\nJB carried out the design and implementation of the sys\ntem and drafted the manuscript.

Despite persistent doubts, governments,\ninternational agencies, NGOs, and private companies are pressing ahead to set\nup more such projects. This paper studies the anancial sustainability of India's\nlargest rural ICT initiative known as eChoupal. The eChoupals are distinct from\nother telecenter projects in that the value added is not in providing ICT\ninfrastructure alone, but rather, in enabling efaciencies in the agricultural\nsector through greater information exchange and creation of an alternative\nmarket structure.\nAn analysis of available data indicates that this project has a potential\npayback period of 3.9 years. Although several assumptions have been used in\nthese calculations, a sensitivity analysis has been performed to provide a range\nof possible scenarios that show the proatability of the project. Through this\nanalysis it seems that ICT projects can be anancially sustainable when they are\nviewed not as an end in themselves but as tools to facilitate information\nexchange whereby, use of the technology enables higher efaciencies in\nanother existing or new business setting, which provides the source of\nrevenue to recover the initial investment.\nThe last decade has seen exponential growth in information and commu\nnication technologies (ICTs) with computers, digital organizers, mobile\nphones, Internet, and wireless computing spreading all across the globe.\nThese technologies have unleashed a \"cultural revolution in the way indi\nviduals and organizations interact, in terms of time, cost and distance\"\n(Munyua, 2000). Apart from changing business and government activities,\nthe potential of these technologies to act as a catalyst to promote socio\neconomic development in Third World countries has become a popular\ntopic of discussion among development agencies, NGOs, governments,\nacademicians, and experts. The Food and Agricultural Organization of the\nUnited Nations noted in one of the earliest books on the topic of ICTs and\ndevelopment that being a \"oexible, decentralized, information-sharing\ntool,\" the Internet\noffer[ed] the possibility of initiating economic development for agricul\ntural producers, expanding the effectiveness of community develop\nment programmes, increasing the amount of participatory research\nconducted, promoting small business enterprises, and improving news\n(c) 2005 The Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nInformation Technologies and International Development\nVolume 2, Number 1, Fall 2004, 45-73\n\neCHOUPALS\nmedia networks. If used as a tool for encouraging\ntwo-way communication processes and creating\nlinks between people, then it may open up new\nopportunities for rural people to participate in the\nglobal society (Paisley and Richardson, 1998).\nIn the 1980s, community access points (CAPs)\nemerged in Scandinavia whereby entire communities\naccessed computer technology through a shared\ncenter known as a telecottage. Since the mid-1990s,\nthere has been an explosion of such centers--now\ncalled telecenters--that deploy Internet technology\nsupported by international and national donor agen\ncies, governments, and even private-sector compa\nnies in developing countries. Roman and Colle\n(2002) from Cornell University characterize this\n\"telecenter movement\" as an eclectic process,\nlargely devoid of systematic research and planning.\nBillions of dollars have been allocated by arst-world\ndevelopment organizations, such as the G8, World\nBank, UNDP, and bilateral grant agencies, in addition\nto developing country governments and nonproat\norganizations, to set up and sustain these projects.\nLittle careful empirical study, however, has been con\nducted to evaluate the impact of ICTs on poverty re\nduction or socioeconomic development. In fact,\naccording to Heeks and Davies (1999),\nfailure has been downplayed. . . . estimates sug\ngest that the majority of ICT based initiatives end\nin total failure of a system that never works; par\ntial failure in which major goals are unattained or\nin which there are signiacant undesirable out\ncomes; sustainability failure that succeeds initially\nbut then fails after a year or so; or replication fail\nure of a pilot scheme that cannot be reproduced\n(authors' emphasis).\nIn the context of anite and time-bound donor\nfunding, sustainability in the long run and replica\ntion (or scalability) of the project are crucial factors.\nTypically, donor agencies do not expect to fund\nthese projects beyond an initial incubation period,\nand evaluation of community telecenters focuses\ncarefully on returns on anancial and other invest\nments apart from the achievement of initial social\nobjectives (Whyte, 2001). The International Develop\nment and Research Centre (IDRC) of Canada de\nmands a strong business plan at the end of a 3-year\nperiod, according to Richard Fuchs, director of the\nInformation and Communication Technologies for\nDevelopment Program Area (Cisler, 2002). The\nWorld Bank Development Gateway, the ACACIA ini\ntiative of IDRC, the InfoDev program, and the World\nSummit on Information Society all have sustainability\nas a vital question on their agenda.\nThe term sustainability seems to have come into\ncommon usage as the phrase sustainable develop\nment emerged in 1987 with the publication of Our\nCommon Future, the report of the World Commis\nsion on Environment and Development. The com\nmission deaned sustainable development as a form\nof progress that ensures human development and\nthat \"meets the needs of the present without com\npromising the ability of future generations to meet\ntheir own needs\" (Brundtland, 1987). In the realm\nof development projects, sustainability most often\nrefers to anancing of the project in the long run,\neither from commercial revenue or from continuing\ndonor support.\nSome development experts such as Bjorn\nWellenius (2003) of the World Bank argue that\ntelecenters may not be able to achieve commercial\nsustainability beyond initial public support in poor\nand rural localities. In fact, demand for anancial\nsustainability may not even be appropriate given\nthat \"many places do not have enough people with\nmoney to spend on the needed services,\" writes\nCisler (2002) of the Association for Community Net\nworking, even though the projects may be impor\ntant to the community. Many telecenters face the\nquestion of how they can generate income yet serve\nthose in the community who cannot afford to pay\nfor \"public goods\" kinds of services, such as access\nto health information (Roman & Colle, 2002).\nIt is important to realize that donor money spent\non ICT projects means explicitly not investing it in\nother development areas. Heeks (1999) challenges\n\"ICT fetishists\" to demonstrate how ICT-based infor\nmation represents a more important resource than\nwater, food, land, shelter, production technology,\nmoney, skills, or power in the development process.\nMany of these projects are on a pilot, demonstra\ntion, or proof-of-concept level, and most literature\nenumerates positive impacts of information empow\nerment on a small scale or an anecdotal basis; but\none cannot make inferences for the potential impact\nof ICTs on a larger scale or for the longer term. The\nopportunity cost of development money is very high\nand \"telecenters that cannot anance themselves in\nInformation Technologies and International Development\n\nthe long run become a drain on public resources.\n[Moreover], telecenters not subject to market disci\nplines lack incentives to perform well and the ability\nto face competition when it arrives,\" cautions Wel\nlenius (2003). More signiacantly, if a telecenter is\ndoing well today, can it continue to provide those\nbeneats in the long term? What happens to the\nproject when the funding runs out? If a telecenter\ndoes not generate enough revenue to cover opera\ntional and maintenance costs apart from generating\na surplus to replace equipment, \"inevitable equip\nment breakdowns and obsolescence will eventually\nforce the telecentre to shut down,\" warns Proenza\nof the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization\n(2001).\nIn addition to anancial sustainability, the litera\nture elaborates on social/cultural, political/institu\ntional, and technological sustainability for long-term\nsurvival of telecenters. Batchelor and Norrish (2002)\ndeane social sustainability as minimizing social ex\nclusion and maximizing social equity. This means en\nsuring access to the telecentre for heterogeneous\ngroups of people in the community and responding\nto their different needs. Delgadillo et al. (2002) of\nthe IDRC observe that \"if people in the community\nfeel themselves empowered by the telecentre,\nthey will be more active in seeking ways to keep it\nrunning.\"\nPolitical sustainability stems from the recognition\nthat one of the biggest threats to ICT-enabled pro\njects is resistance to change, particularly from vested\ninterests set to lose out in the process of informa\ntion exchange (Tinio, 2002-2003). Gaining the co\noperation of community leaders and policy makers is\nnecessary to create an environment or a \"regulatory\nframework that will protect, promote and support\ncommunity telecentres and their activities\"\n(Delgadillo et al., 2002).\nTechnological sustainability is fundamentally re\nlated to anancial sustainability since the most visible\ncost usually comprises equipment and technical\nmaintenance. Various projects are trying to adopt\nmodular techniques to make these components of\nsustainability an integral part of their functioning.\nKUMAR\nNevertheless, Munyua (2000) notes that \"most pro\njects established with external funding face major\nchallenges after the project period has ended. . . .\nThere are as yet few examples of success in attain\ning such sustainability, and there is an urgent need\nfor viable models to be developed and tested.\nThis paper is a study of a commercially moti\nvated, rural ICT initiative in the state of Madhya\nPradesh in India focusing on the question of\nanancial sustainability. It does not address the ques\ntions of social, political, technological, or institu\ntional sustainability, which are perhaps more\nimportant. While recognizing this limitation of the\npaper, the author has chosen to focus on anancial\nsustainability because without it, the project will not\nsurvive. The concerns of sociopolitical impact (for in\nstance, impact based on caste, class, gender, and\noccupation, and the relationship of the project to\npolitical and institutional forces in the village, etc.)\nwill be addressed by the author in a forthcoming\npaper.\nThe software services export boom in India has been\naccompanied by another, parallel explosion of pro\njects described by the Economic and Political Weekly\nas \"one of the largest set of civil society experiments\nto use ICTs to empower as well as to increase the\nrange of services to the marginalised at reduced\ncosts\" (Vijaybhaskar & Gayathri, 2003). Not only\nhave several state governments and nonproat insti\ntutions started ICT projects such as Gyandoot,\nBhoomi, TARAhaat, and Jiva telecenters,1 but in\ncreasingly venture capitalists have entered the fray.\nA sound business plan, stressing market knowledge,\neconomical use of resources, and revenue generat\ning capacity (Delgadillo et al., 2002), has been the\nhallmark of these commercially-sponsored ventures,\nwhich aim to tap the potential market of 600-700\nmillion Indians living in rural areas by using informa\ntion technology to provide them with much-needed\nconnectivity and ICT-based services.\nThis paper undertakes an evaluation of the\nanancial sustainability of India's largest commercial\nICT project, started by the India Tobacco Company's\n1. Gyandoot: an e-government project started in 2000 in Dhar district, Madhya Pradesh (www.gyandoot.nic.in);\nBhoomi: an online land records available through kiosks set up by the government of Karnataka (http://www.revdept\n01.kar.nic.in); TARAhaat: an e-commerce portal and telecenters set up by the NGO Development Alternatives\n(www.tarahaat.com); Jiva Institute: telecenters known as Baatchit that provide education and other services (http://\nwww.jiva.org/enterprise/baatchit.asp).\nVolume 2, Number 1, Fall 2004\n\neCHOUPALS\nInternational Business Division (ITC-IBD),2 known as\nthe eChoupals. The eChoupals are unique in con\nception and different from the usual telecenter proj\nect. Their actual value proposition is the provision of\nfutures' price information and the creation of an al\nternative buying infrastructure, which is supported\nby computers and connectivity. Financial\nsustainability of the eChoupals depends on the abil\nity to recover the investment of the ICT infrastruc\nture but the returns to this project are not from\ntransactions related to the computer but rather from\nthe larger re-engineering of the agricultural supply\nchain. Most ICT projects set up the infrastructure\nand then agure out how best to recover the cost of\nthat investment. The struggle is to and viable busi\nness propositions by providing information or ser\nvices through the established network. In contrast,\nthe eChoupals (also known as soyachoupals3 in the\nstate of Madhya Pradesh where the primary rainy/\nsummer season crop is soybean) fundamentally dif\nfer from this approach. For the eChoupals, ICTs are\nnot valuable in themselves, but generate value only\nwhen they enable the creation of an alternative ag\nricultural infrastructure through the exchange of in\nformation, as will be evident from the analysis that\nfollows.\nEvaluation of available data on revenue and costs\nof the eChoupals suggests that this initiative has the\npotential to be anancially sustainable in the long\nrun. The payback period for all capital investment\nand running costs is 3.9 years. This is exceptional\ngiven that most ICT projects are struggling even to\nrecover daily operating costs. A sensitivity analysis\nshows both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios in\nTable 6, but in the worst case, payback (without de\npreciation) is 5.8 years, and in the best case, pay\nback is 3.5 years and the project is able to pay for\nthe replacement cost of the entire capital within 7\nyears. Several assumptions regarding the correct\nmeasurement of capital and operating costs, as well\nas calculations of savings/revenue, are noted in the\npaper, which could make the conclusion vary to a\ncertain extent. Despite these problems, it is hoped\nthat this study will encourage further empirical re\nsearch into the question of the long-term\nsustainability of ICTs for development.\nIn December 2002 and January 2003, the author\nspent 3 weeks studying the eChoupals,4 arst inter\nviewing ITC-IBD personnel at the arm's headquarters\nin Hyderabad for 5 days, then traveling to the\nsoyachoupals near Bhopal and Indore in Madhya\nPradesh for 14 days, speaking to choupal operators,\nto farmers, and to villagers using the choupals.5 De\ntailed questionnaires for operators, farmers, traders,\nvillagers, and ITC-IBD personnel were developed and\nused as guides for conducting formal and informal\ninterviews. Group discussions were conducted at tea\nshops, market places, and village congregation areas\n(Panchayat bhavans), as well as at the choupal pre\nmises themselves.\nFinancial data were obtained from the Hydera\nbad and Bhopal ofaces in raw form (from ITC-IBD's\nonline anancial management software and from\ndata tables on eChoupal transactions maintained by\nthe anancial team in Bhopal) and were amalgam\nated by the author. This was supported by inter\nviews with ITC-IBD operations, anance, and\ntechnical managers, with personnel in two process\ning plants, and with other aeld staff. For instance,\nagures for the average cost of an eChoupal were\ncompared from different sources within the com\npany (see Footnote 1 in Table 4) and also cross\nchecked with the cost of kiosks set up by other pro\njects studied by the author. Similarly, data on operat\ning costs were obtained from separate sources in\nHyderabad and Bhopal and were re-checked in in\nterviews with technical support staff. For revenue/\n2. ITC-IBD stands for India Tobacco Company-International Business Division. ITC and ITC-IBD are used interchangeably\nin this paper to denote the same company.\n3. eChoupals, choupals, and soyachoupals are used interchangeably in this paper to refer to ITC-IBD's village Internet\nkiosks in Madhya Pradesh.\n4. Prior to research on the eChoupals, the author spent some time working and researching in Uttar Pradesh (north In\ndia) at TARAhaat's village Internet centres started by the NGO Development Alternatives. Following this, the author\nworked with n-Logue Communications, a company based out of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, to set up\nvillage Internet kiosks and conceptualize and implement Internet-based services in the south Indian state of Tamil\nNadu.\n5. See Appendix A for a list of the choupals visited and the characteristics of the villages they serviced.\nInformation Technologies and International Development\n\nKUMAR\nsavings data, the output from ITC-IBD's electronic\ntransaction system, Entrest, was calculated at\nBhopal by adding up total tons bought by ITC-IBD\nfrom all the choupals and using the daily futures'\nprice quoted by ITC. Individual choupals visited by\nthe author were asked to verify the total amount of\nsoybean they had supplied to the company in the\nlast year to see if it tallied with the data in Entrest\n(Appendix A).\nThe anancial analysis was sent to managers in\nHyderabad and Bhopal to verify the accuracy of the\nstatistics and claims made in the paper. They sug\ngested a number of corrections, which have been\nincorporated into the analysis.6 The data have been\nput through rigorous tests using conservative dis\ncounting rates for the opportunity cost of capital,\nthe failure of monsoons (since the revenue is directly\ndependent on buying agricultural produce), and dif\nfering rates of depreciation. Six scenarios were ana\nlyzed, ranging from highly pessimistic to fairly\noptimistic, based on revenue data from soybean\nprocurement. If other potential revenue streams us\ning the existing infrastructure are added (savings\nfrom buying wheat and commission from rural\ndistribution through the same choupals) then\nproatability in all scenarios is fairly realistic.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section two\ndescribes the soybean agricultural market structure\nin Madhya Pradesh followed by the changes\nbrought through the eChoupals and analyzes the\nbeneats accruing to farmers and ITC-IBD (Table 1).\nThe third section and Table 2 enumerate the total\nrevenue for ITC-IBD over a 16-month period and dis\ncusses possible sources of revenue in the future. The\nfourth section presents ITC's variation of the\ntelecenter model and the afth section enumerates\nthe capital costs and operating costs of the eChou\npals (Tables 3, 4, and 5), which have been com\npletely borne by ITC. This is followed by an analysis\nof the anancial data in Table 6 using standard mea\nsures of return on investment and payback period to\nascertain the anancial sustainability of the project. In\nthe last section, this paper provides a brief discus\nsion of the social context of the eChoupals in the\nvillages and reoects upon the potential of this large-\nscale project to bring about signiacant changes in\nrural India.\nITC-IBD is the 13-year-old agri-business division of\nthe large Indian conglomerate, India Tobacco Com\npany Ltd. ITC-IBD primarily procures and exports ag\nricultural commodities in raw or processed form and\nis India's largest overall agricultural exporter. With\nthe opening up of Indian agricultural markets in\n1996-97 under the World Trade Organization's\nrules, ITC faced increasing competition from large,\nlow-cost suppliers of agricultural products in the\nUnited States, Brazil, and other countries. ITC's pro\ncurement costs were much higher due to gross\ninefaciencies in India's markets, detailed in an\ninouential report on the state of Indian agriculture\nreleased in 1997 by McKinsey and Company (FAIDA\nreport; Confederation of Indian Industry and\nMcKinsey and Company 1997). This report lamented\nIndia's low productivity and wastage in production\nand distribution, particularly arising from the small\nsize of landholdings in the country, as a source of\nhigher costs to processors like ITC.\nLet us take the example of soybean. ITC-IBD has\na network of 130-140 commission agents (CAGs,\nor traders) in the state of Madhya Pradesh who co\nordinate the buying of soybean from wholesale mar\nket yards (mandis) and from a network of smaller\ntraders. ITC-IBD arranges for the processing of all\nsoybean it buys to produce soybean oil, which is\nsold domestically, and de-oiled cake, which is ex\nported for cattle feed to the Middle East and South\neast Asia. Farmers bring their produce in trolleys, or\nsmall wagons, to the mandi, where it is auctioned\nto a group of traders, some of whom are agents for\ncompanies like ITC. These agents weigh and bag the\nmaterial they purchase, settle the price for the\nfarmer and send the produce to ITC's warehouses\nfor processing. ITC pays its agents a commission\nalong with the cost of bagging and transportation\nover and above the price of soybean. Farmers, too,\nhave to pay the agents for weighing the produce\nonce it has been auctioned and for labor charges in\n6. ITC-IBD was open and cooperative, both in providing the data and in checking the anancial analysis. However, any\nerrors that remain and claims made in the conclusion are the sole responsibility of the author.\nVolume 2, Number 1, Fall 2004\n\neCHOUPALS\nvolved in moving it to the agent's warehouse. Many\nagents directly collect the produce of large farmers\nfrom the village itself (and get paid extra), while\nsmall and medium-sized farmers usually take their\nproduce to the village trader who, in turn, goes to\nthe mandi to sell to larger commission agents, such\nas ITC.\nGiven the lack of basic physical infrastructure in\nthe Indian countryside, such as paved roads, cold\nstorage facilities, warehouses, telecom connectivity,\netc., and given the geographic dispersion of farmers\nand the small farm sizes, traders, commission\nagents, and local mandis have been seen as neces\nsary to ensure the distribution of agricultural pro\nduce. These middlemen take the responsibility for\nquality and bear the anancial risk of trading with\nlarge numbers of farmers. Often, they are also the\nbrokers of anancial capital for seeds and inputs\n(seed, fertilizer, and pesticides).\nLocal traders have the power to quote a given\nprice to farmers, as well as the authority to down\ngrade the price according to their own estimation of\nthe quality of the produce. Manohar Mandloi, an\neChoupal entrepreneur from Kurana village, elabo\nrates, \"Traders change their prices all day. In the\nmorning they will buy at a higher price, say, one\ntruck for 1,300 Rs. a quintal and another for 1,000\nRs. Over the course of the day, they will keep reduc\ning the price and anally buy several inferior quality\nlots just for 400-500 Rs.7 Then they mix it all and\nsell it for a proat.\" In this manner, ITC and other\ncompanies get a lower overall quality of soybean,\nwhich upon processing yields less oil and more con\ntaminated de-oiled cake.\nIn the mandi, although the auction generally\ntakes place in a competitive manner,8 prices ouctu\nate at least 20 rupees per quintal in either direction\non a daily basis. Ever since the soybean market in In\ndia was pegged to the world price in 1999, how\never, downward and upward trends have become\nmore difacult to ascertain. Earlier, it was clear that if\na farmer was able to hold on to the crop and sell af\nter the season was over (i.e., after January or Febru\nary rather than in September or October), he would\nget a better price. Today, with soybean from Brazil\nand the United States coming on the market at dif\nferent times of the year, the ouctuation in prices has\nbecome uncertain over the course of a year.9 Traders\nhave information on these price ouctuations\nthrough their contact with larger market yards and\nexport companies like ITC, and are able to maximize\ntheir own proat margins at the expense of farmers\nwho are unable to predict price changes.\nTo lower its procurement cost and improve its qual\nity of soybean, in 2000 ITC-IBD developed the con\ncept of the eChoupal. eChoupals are village Internet\nkiosks run by local entrepreneurs who provide fu\ntures' price information to farmers10 and enable\nthem to sell their produce directly to ITC, bypassing\nthe middlemen and wholesale market yards\n(mandis). Through the eChoupals, ITC spends less\nper ton of produce (since it is not paying commis\nsions and transaction costs to middlemen) and farm\ners know the price they will receive for their produce\nif they sell the next day.\nBest and Maclay (2002) have called into question\nthe beneats of the provision of market price infor\nmation for the agricultural sector. They argue that\nother community characteristics including availability\nof transport, credit, and alternative markets are im\nportant factors that determine whether farmers can\nact upon the market price information they have\nobtained. The eChoupal concept has taken this into\naccount by setting up a buying infrastructure paral\nlel to the traditional mandi system. This includes\nfour processing plants and nine warehouses in\nMadhya Pradesh (that were in operation as of Janu\nary 2003) where farmers can come directly with\ntheir produce, reimbursement of transport costs to\n7. One dollar was equal to approximately 50 rupees (Rs.) in 2003.\n8. There are certain problems even with the mandi system where the high cost of entry for traders, a monopoly by an\ninouential group of agents, and price axing are not unknown. Delving into these issues, however, is beyond the scope\nof this paper.\n9. See http://www.cbot.com/cbot/pub/page/0,3181,1288,00.html for historical soybean price volatility at the Chicago\nBoard of Trade. Accessed March 10, 2004.\n10. ITC pegs the price for each day based on the previous day's international market rate for soybean. ITC takes a risk\nin that, if the market plunges the next day, ITC still must honor its commitment to farmers at the quoted futures' price,\nand incur a loss.\nInformation Technologies and International Development\n\nKUMAR\nfarmers at a axed rate per quintal,11 and an entre\npreneur (called a sanchalak)12 who runs the choupal\nin the village helps farmers analyze the price infor\nmation, and arranges transportation. In many cases,\nsanchalaks transport the material at their own ex\npense to compete against traders who come to the\nvillage and directly negotiate deals with large farm\ners, thus bypassing the mandi altogether.13\nThe main advantage of ITC's price is that it is a\nquote for the future. Usually when a farmer sells at\nthe mandi, he has already borne the expense of\nbringing his produce to market and is forced to sell\nat whatever rate he can get because it is too expen\nsive to transport the material back to the village and\nback to market. He may have found out the prevail\ning rate from returning farmers along the highway\nor from local trading outposts or even from the local\nlanguage newspaper in the region, but these prices\nare for earlier in the day or the prior day. Through\nthe eChoupal, before leaving the village farmers\nknow what price to expect based on a particular\nlevel of quality. Moreover, those choupals with\nInternet access can provide access to world market\ntrends in soybean from the Chicago Board of\nTrade.14\nOnce a farmer has decided to sell to ITC, the\nsanchalak gives him a sauda number (transaction\nslip) that is shown to the ofacer at the processing\nplant or warehouse (to be able to track the amount\nof soybean coming from each choupal). At the\nplant, the crop is arst tested for quality using an\nelectronic machine in the laboratory. Any farmer\nwho contests the results can ask for resampling and\nretesting of their crop's quality. If the quality is\nwithin the limits of 2% bad seed, 2% foreign mat\nter, and 10% moisture, the farmer obtains the high\nest price advertised the night before. Inferior quality\nmaterial is downgraded in price by ITC's sampling\nofacer.16 Once a farmer accepts the price, the pro\nduce is weighed on a large, automated scale instead\nof on a manual scale. In other words, the entire\nloaded trolley is weighed, then emptied into the silo\n11. ITC was setting up choupals in villages more than 100 km away from its four processing plants, making it difacult\nfor farmers to come all the way. So it started an incentive system to pay a certain amount per quintal as freight ex\npenses for every kilometer farmers traveled to reach the plants. ITC also rented nine warehouses in areas away from\nthe four processing plants so that the nearby choupal farmers could travel less to sell their produce to ITC.\n12. There are no women operators/entrepreneurs because ITC's selection criteria speciacally call for a male operator of\na medium-sized farm in the village. A discussion of the gender implications of this choice, while crucial for evaluating\nthe claims of ICT projects to promote overall rural prosperity and socioeconomic development, is beyond the scope of\nthis paper. This topic will be addressed in a forthcoming article by the author that examines the social aspects of the\nuse and beneats of the eChoupals. This paper refers to operators using the masculine gender to draw attention to this\nimportant issue.\n13. In other cases, ITC's commission agents organize for bulk transportation and get paid an extra commission from\nITC.\n14. ITC has been experimenting with a system known as Jhangad, where farmers \"sell\" their soybean to ITC as soon as\nthey harvest it, and receive 10% of the total price quoted on that day. They also sign a futures' bond whereby on a\nday of their choice within the next 6 months, the farmers can come back to ITC and collect the rest of the money\nbased on the price prevailing that day. This way, ITC gets the soybean into its processing system and is able to maintain\nlarge buffer stocks to use during the lean season; and farmers lacking storage facilities have the option of getting a\nhigher price sometime in the future by paying a nominal fee to ITC.\n15. One of ITC's processing plants was close to the Mandideep mandi (near Bhopal) and competed directly with the\nmandi for a share of the soybean from the surrounding areas. The largest trader at this mandi complained that they\nwere losing margins and market share to ITC ever since the eChoupals were started. Moreover, ITC had employed an\nagent to exclusively buy soybean from this mandi for the processing plant. He could bid in the auction up to ITC's\nquoted price for the day. This created a minimum price cushion under which no other trader could bid and get away\nwith it unless the quality of the material was very poor. Thus, even at this particular mandi, farmers were assured of\ngetting, at minimum, ITC's price for their crop (albeit without the other beneats of freight reimbursements, etc.).\nFarmers who came to sell speciacally at the mandi would often inquire about ITC's price to make sure they were get\nting the best possible deal.\n16. While this may be better than a manipulative trader, there are margins of error in this system. both machine and\nhuman. The lab technician pegged the machine at about 3-4% margin of error but did not consider this to be\nsigniacantly large. Most farmers seemed to treat the lab's analysis as \"genuine\" compared to the trader's \"sight\" analy\nsis. While in practice disputes may occur, the author did not have an opportunity to witness such a case.\nVolume 2, Number 1, Fall 2004\n\neCHOUPALS\nand reweighed to get the weight of the soybean de\nlivered. In the manual process of the mandi, the ma\nterial was packed into bags that were then weighed,\nleaving room for seeds to fall on the ground and ex\ncluded from the weighing. Furthermore, the mandi\nprocess gave the person balancing the scales an un\ndue advantage to tip against the farmer. Many\nfarmers complained that they would regularly lose\n1-2 kilograms per bag (each bag holds approxi\nmately 90 kg of material) at the mandi compared\nwith ITC's electronic weigh-bridge. The farmer had\nto pay the trader in the mandi for tulai (labor\ncharges for weighing) and hammali (labor charges\nfor bagging and storing). In ITC's case, these services\nare free, since the grain is directly stored in ITC's si\nlos, instead of being bagged. And anally, ITC gives\nfarmers full payment for produce at the time of the\ntransaction, unlike the mandi, the government-buy\ning center (Tilansangh), or even many traders who\npay in installments or pay after some amount of\ntime ranging from a few days to a few months. The\nfarmer's cost of selling to ITC is reduced to nearly\nzero since there is no payment for bagging or\nweighing, and freight is paid by ITC.17 ITC-IBD esti\nmates that on average it saves Rs. 275 per ton of\nsoybean purchased through the choupals, while\nfarmers save Rs. 270 per ton. Table 1 shows the av\nerage transaction costs incurred both by ITC and the\nfarmer in the traditional system and through the\nchoupals.\nSoybean procurement is only one aspect of the\nlarger project of ITC's eChoupal network. ITC also\nprovides updates on the weather and access to\nlower-priced inputs through pooled purchasing at\nwholesale prices. Further, ITC has plans over the\nnext several years to use the choupal network to\nconnect farmers to agricultural scientists and to in\nformation on best practices to encourage higher\nproductivity. With improving rural incomes, ITC\nhopes to convert the buying process into a cost-ef\nfective rural distribution network selling consumer\nproducts, to villagers, such as motorbikes and televi\nsions, and services, such as insurance.\nTable 2 calculates the savings accruing to ITC over\nthe arst 16 months of operation of the eChoupals\nto December 2002. The data for Year 1 is for the\nentire year, while the data for Year 2 is for the arst\n4 months of the season.\nFrom the nearly 73,400 tons of soybean pur\nchased through the eChoupals in the arst season\n(over and above the regular procurement of soybean\nthrough ITC's commission agents in the mandis--\nnearly 30% of all soybean bought by ITC that year),\nITC calculated that it saved Rs. 13.3 million in trans\naction costs or almost 2% of the total value of the\nproduce (Table 2). Moreover, through the choupal\nsystem, the produce comes loose in trolleys (usually\nfrom a single farm) without being mixed and\nbagged at the mandi, and is of better quality com\npared with mandi-procured soybean.18 Conse\nquently, ITC-IBD estimates saving Rs. 12.9 million in\nthe arst year of operation through better quality of\noil and de-oiled cake after processing the choupal\nsoybean (Table 2).19\nOf a total 460 choupals in operation during the\narst year (September 2001 to June 2002), farmers\n17. At certain ITC warehouses where electronic weighing machines are not available, farmers have to pay for manual\nweighing at the rate of Rs. 3-5 per quintal up to 10-15 Rs. per quintal. Also, at the Indore processing plant, payment\nfor freight was discontinued due to irregularities. Instead, the price per ton was increased by Rs. 20-30 across the\nboard. Many large farmers do not even travel to the mandi to sell their produce since traders negotiate the deal at the\nvillage and pick up the material as soon as it is threshed. For these farmers, the opportunity cost of the time they\nspend transporting the produce is an important component of the cost. Thus, transaction costs for farmers would not\nbe zero in all cases.\n18. The choupal material usually comes directly on trolleys and is not mixed or bagged, and is directly unloaded into\nthe silos. Material from CAGs usually comes bagged in trucks, which are then unloaded into huge storage areas cov\nered by tarpaulin.\n19. In the arst year, ITC ran a separate batch of soybean procured from the choupal through its processing plant and\nthen ran a batch of material from the mandi. The difference obtained in quality was used as the baseline for calculat\ning savings of approximately Rs. 200 per ton. In all, Rs. 7.5 million were saved as crude oil, Rs. 2 million as reaned oil,\nand Rs. 3.4 million as protein content of the de-oiled cake, or a total of Rs. 12.9 million. This data was provided by\nRaghav Jhawar, anance manager, ITC-IBD Bhopal.\nInformation Technologies and International Development\n\nKUMAR\nTable 1.

Labor Khadi\nKarai is payment for moving the bags to the agent's warehouse. Handling loss occurs when the produce\nis packed into bags and some seeds fall on the ground.\n3The material from different farmers is mixed by the laborers, put into bags and the bags are stitched up\nat the agent's warehouse. A truck is hired to transport the stitched bags to the processing plant where\nanother set of laborers unloads them. All this is paid for by ITC-IBD.\n4Instead of paying CAGs, ITC pays a commission per ton to the person who runs the choupal in the vil\nlage. This person, called the sanchalak, advertises the choupal to farmers, informs them of ITC's price\nand the market price, and gives them a transaction slip when they decide to sell to ITC.\n5Through the choupal system, ITC must pay the farmers and sanchalaks as well as manage large cash\nflows. ITC has commissioned a bank or its CAGs to do the same.\n6ITC has started an incentive system to attract more farmers to use the choupals whereby it pays freight\ncharges to farmers as a fixed amount per kilometer for the distance from village to factory.\nfrom 280 choupals sold soybean to ITC.20 In the sec-\nacre in the second year was close to 3-4 quintals\nond season, starting September 2002, the number\nper acre instead of the usual 7-10 quintals per acre.\nof choupals increased to 796 and total procurement\nSecond, due to increasing price ouctuations in world\nat the end of 4 months (through December 31,\nmarkets, there were many days when prices in the\n2002) was 60,547 tons from the 550 choupals in\nmandi were greater than those ITC had quoted the\noperation.

Sep\ntember is chosen as the start date for anancial calculations because that is when the freshly harvested soybean arst\ncomes to market.\nVolume 2, Number 1, Fall 2004\n\neCHOUPALS\nSoyachoupals\nthe\nthrough\nSoybean\nof\nProcurement\nof\nAnalysis\nCost-Revenue-Savings\n2.\nTable\nInformation Technologies and International Development\n-\nSep.\nAug.\ntons\n73,400\ntons\n268,068\n27.38%\n725,000,000\nRs.\n3,240,952,712\nRs.\n--\n--\n1,778,173,204\n5,019,125,916\nRs.\nRs.\n773,600,000\nRs.\n1,498,600,000\nRs.\n43.79%\n32.94%\ntons\ntons\n138,524\n406,592\ntons\ntons\n60,547\n133,947\n-\nfor\n31,\nMonths\nDec.\nSep.\nOverall\nto\nSeptember\nmuch\nmaterial\nwas\ncost\nfrom\n(raw\nthe\nactually\nfarmer\nto\nis\nquantity,\ncalendar\npaid\nmandis.\nsmaller\nprice\nthe\nsale\nthe\nsoya\nat\nITC\nincludes\ndespite\nThe\nof\nCost\nHence,\n2002.\nbehalf\nLanded\n2001-Aug.\non\n.\ncosts.\n1.\near\nsoybean\nday\nITC-IBD.\nbuy\nassociated\nY\nin\neach\nouctuations.\nSep.\n9,890.05\nwho\nChoupals\nother\nRs.\nmarket\n-Bhopal,\nfrom\nPradesh\nand\nmanager\nwas\nmonths.\nthe\nwith\nsoyachoupals\nfor\nfrom\nonly\nrequired),\nMadhya\ncompared\ninternational\nanance\nin\nsoybean\nby\n(if\ndata\n,\nJhawar\nthe\nhas\nCAGs\nprocure\nbagging\near\nY\nin\ngoverned\nthrough\nseason\nRaghav\n130-140\nto\nand\nITC\nsecond\nfor\n11,719.79\nis\nby\nsoybean\nabout\nRs.\nCost\nprovided\nof\nThe\nwas\nprocurement\nhas\ntransportation\nseed\nsoybean\nsown.\nLanded\nof\nSanchalak,\nton\nITC\nprice\nwere\nis\ncrop\nAgent.\ntable\nfor\nnext\naggregate\nper\nsoybean\ndaily\nCommission\nto\nThe\nthis\nseason\nthe\ncommission\nof\n2.\nthe\nPrice\near\nfor\nis\nY\ndata\narst\nwhen\nin\n=\nCost\nThe\nThe\nCAG\notal\nJune\nprice),\nAverage\nT\ngreater\n\nKUMAR\nSoyachoupals\nthe\nthrough\nSoybean\nof\nProcurement\nof\nAnalysis\nCost-Revenue-Savings\ncontinued.\nTable\nVolume 2, Number 1, Fall 2004\n-\nSep.\nAug.\n13,300,000\nRs.\nRs.\n1.83%\n12,900,000\nRs.\n1.78%\n3.61%\n26,200,000\n15,500,000\nRs.\nRs.\nRs.41,700,000\n2.00%\n2.78%\n0.39%\n1.06%\n3,000,000\n15,900,000\nRs.\nRs.\n1.59%\n1.71%\nRs.\nRs.\n12,500,000\n25,800,000\nRs.\nRs.\n-\nfor\n31,\nmonths\nDec.\nSep.\nOverall\n-\nag\nis\nper\nand\nThe\nThis\nthe\nnd\nsaved\noil\na\nchoupal.\nat\nof\nmandi.\noil,\n1.\nmoney\nCAGs\nquality\nthe\nreaned\near\nY\nthe\nby\nof\nfrom\nthan\nbetter\nthrough\namount\nsoybean\nmaterial\nas\nmillion\nlower\nother\nprovides\nbought\naverage\nof\nmuch\nwith\nit\nbatch\nRs.\noil,\nwas\nton\nthe\nbagged\n19).\na\none\nobtain\nprocessed,\nran\ncrude\nvs.\nand\nas\namount\nis\nthen\ntests.\nand\nday\nsaved\nthe\neach\nsoybean\nto\nchoupals\nand\nmixed\nand\nthis\nfootnotes\nplant\nwas\nsample\nmandi\nbeen\ny\ntests\nthe\n(see\nmillion\nWhen\nprocessing\nlaborator\nthrough\nnot\nthe\nsample\n7.5\nhas\nminimal).\nits\nRs.\nthrough\ny\nfrom\ndetails.\nand\nlaborator\nbought\nbought\nfor\naeld\ncomparisons\nsavings.\nthrough\nsavings.\nof\nsoybean\ntons\nfarmer's\nare\nseed\nalone\nof\nbasis\nof\nable\nthrough\nT\nbad\nthe\nof\ncost\nSee\ncorroborated\nsingle\nCost\nnumber\nimprovement\nchoupal\ncalculation\nLanded\ntransaction\nwas\non\nand\nton.\na\nThis\nonly\ntotal\nper\nmatter,\nfor\nfrom\nthe\ntotal\nquality\nfrom\nbaseline\ncake.\nthe\ntotal\nby\nRs.\nusually\nthe\nthe\nof\nforeign\ncalculated\nthe\ndivided\nis\nthis\nrange\nas\nde-oiled\nmoisture,\nwere\nobtain\nchoupal\nfor\nprocured\nbetween\nis\nsoybean\nused\nthe\nthe\nvalue\nof\near\nsavings\nwas\nY\nto\nthe\n(i.e.\na\nin\ndifference\nseason\nin\nto\nfrom\nquality\nof\nbe\ncontent\ncost\nimputed\nquality\nquality\nbatch\nentire\ntransaction\nthis\nhas\nthe\nbought\nin\nprotein\nran\nthe\nbetter\na\nITC\nfor\nobtained\nas\nthrough\nestimates\ncalculates\nsoybean\nof\nis\ncake.\nITC\nmillion\nsavings\nITC\ngregated\ntotal\n1,\nit\nITC\near\nton.\nSince\nmandi,\ndeoiled\nY\nIn\ndifference\n3.4\nThe\nThe\nRs.\n\neCHOUPALS\ngood rain year and a bad rain year in determining\nthe proatability of the choupal investment.\nEven though total procurement in Year 2 was\nlow (13,000 tons lower than Year 1), the savings\nfrom transaction costs were almost at the same level\nas the arst year's transaction cost savings (Rs. 12.9\nmillion, in nominal terms). This was because the\nprice of soybean shot up approximately Rs. 2,000 in\nthe second year (or almost 20% higher), as men\ntioned earlier. Savings from better quality only\namounted to Rs. 3 million, much less than in Year 1\n(Table 2, footnote 10).\nDuring Year 1, ITC bought 5,465 tons of wheat\nfrom 95 choupals in January to April 2002. This was\na trial run for wheat and there were plans to pro\ncure many more thousand tons in Year 2. ITC's long-\nterm plan is to make choupals the node for buying\nall commodities grown in villages in Madhya\nPradesh, as well as the distribution centers for agri\ncultural inputs such as seed, fertilizers, pesticides,\nand such consumer items as oil and insurance. The\nsavings documented in Table 2 do not include\nwheat procurement or the proats on the sale of in\nputs and must be treated as partial. In fact, nearly\nRs. 45 million of transactions had taken place in in\nput and consumer goods sales over the course of\nthe arst 16 months of operation. No substantial\ndata on the savings or commissions to ITC from\nthese input sales were available as of January 2003.\nBefore enumerating the costs of the eChoupals and\nworking out a anancial analysis, it is important to\nunderstand the technological and business aspects\nof the village Internet centers. ITC's village Internet\ncenters are run by entrepreneurs selected by the\ncompany. ITC's selection process focuses on anding\na farmer with a medium-sized operation in a village\n(this varies from place to place, depending on the\naverage landholding size) who is well-respected and\ncan be an agent of change. Studies have shown\nthat local entrepreneurs are best able to identify and\nrespond to the needs of customers, investigate the\nmarket, and promote services to a broad population\n(Wellenius, 2003).21 ITC's entrepreneurial model\nrests on this premise but differs from the usual in\nvestment pattern in two distinct ways.\nIn most small entrepreneur business models, the\nindividual invests in the capital equipment and pro\nvides paid services to the entire community to re\ncover the investment. However, in ITC's model, arst,\nthe capital investment for the eChoupals is entirely\nborne by ITC and second, villagers are not charged\nfor any services related to the computer.\nITC covers the capital cost of the computer and\nInternet connectivity. Even costs such as earthing\nand wiring of village locations where the computer\nis to be installed are not left to the entrepreneur. Lo\ncal start-up costs such as labor and services required\nto establish the eChoupal as well as training costs\nfor the center owner are also borne by ITC. The en\ntrepreneur incurs only limited operating costs, such\nas electricity and telephone bills,22 and occasionally\nthe cost of travel to ITC's processing plant or oface\nfor training or for collecting commission payments.\nAn International Telecommunication Union report\nnotes that at the local level the most signiacant op\nerating costs are salaries for employees and other\nbuilding-related costs, such as rent, utilities, mainte\nnance, and security (Townsend, 2002). But the\nsanchalaks did not need to employ someone to run\nthe center because computer use was minimal and\nmost transactions were conducted over the phone.\nMoreover, all choupals were in the houses of\nsanchalaks, eliminating rent payment.23 Neverthe\nless, the sanchalak is foregoing private use of part\nof his house as well as bearing security costs, such\nas building a arm door and installing a lock.\nMr. Sivakumar, CEO of ITC-IBD, explained the ra\n21. Also see R. Kumar & A. Jhunjhunwala, Taking Internet to Villages: Case Study of a Project in the Madurai Region,\nsubmitted to the United Nations Centre for Regional Development (UNCRD), August 2002.

In places with VSATs, ITC takes care of bandwidth costs but in places with dial-up connectivity, the entrepreneur\nhas to pay for the phone line charges. Currently all price information is accessed through the phone and entrepreneurs\npay for that cost from their own pocket.\n23. Having the computer inside the house of the sanchalak creates several barriers to access for others in the village,\nmost notably for farmers from lower castes. However, since the price information was being obtained through the\nphone and being relayed through word of mouth, it quickly becomes public information in the village. Moreover, there\nis not much general use of the computer, hence this provision has not yet become a large hindrance for pursuing the\nmain objectives of the choupal. Nevertheless, the issue of access is a serious one and will be addressed in a forthcom\ning paper by the author.\nInformation Technologies and International Development\n\nKUMAR\ntionale behind this model. First, if an entrepreneur in\nthe village invests his own capital, he expects re\nturns in the short term and on a daily basis. If the\nstream of income is very small, the entrepreneur is\naverse to taking further risk. ITC would like the en\ntrepreneurs to \"think strategically as a group for\nlong-term prospects such as increasing agricultural\nproductivity and enhancing competitiveness instead\nof being concerned with short-term returns.\" In\nother words, by relieving short-term anancial pres\nsures on the sanchalaks, ITC hopes to encourage\ntheir deeper involvement in the project of learning\nhow to use ITC-IBD's capital infrastructure and alli\nances with other organizations to best serve the\nneeds of villagers. Given that sanchalaks as a group\nare themselves leading farmers in their villages, they\nare close to ITC's customers and have a good under\nstanding of local market dynamics.24\nSecond, all use of the eChoupal is free for the\ncommunity and there is no payment to and out\nprices, weather, or information on best practices in\nagriculture. The revenue for ITC-IBD is through the\ntransaction and quality savings outlined above,\nwhile the revenue for the entrepreneur (sanchalak)\ncomes from a 0.5% commission that ITC-IBD gives\nhim on every rupee of produce sold through his\nchoupal. Charging villagers for accessing prices, best\npractices, e-mail, etc., would lead to a \"transaction\noriented, low-equilibrium approach to ICTs,\" em\nphasizes Sivakumar. \"The minute you charge, the\nnumber of people accessing [the information] will\nbecome restricted and eventually you cannot de\nvelop customized solutions for all,\" he argues.\nStoll & Menou assert that a \"business model\"\nbased on the provision of ICT and related services,\non its own, is often not a sufacient basis for achiev\ning anancial sustainability. This is even more likely to\nbe the case if the aim is \"the development of a\ncommunity whose members have initially limited re\nquirements for telecommunications and a very low\npurchasing power, if at all\" (2003). ITC-IBD's aim is\nto provide information for free and thus encourage\na change in transaction behavior. In other words, it\nhopes that farmers will learn about better quality\nagricultural inputs and order them through the\neChoupal, consequently producing a higher quality\ncrop. This way, ITC would obtain further savings\nthrough the buying of better quality agricultural\ncommodities as well as commission from the sale of\ncertiaed agricultural inputs.\nIt is clear, then, that the revenue for the\neChoupal project is not dependent on transactions\nstemming from the direct use of the computer but\nrather from a business proposition that has been en\nabled through the exchange of information. Savings\nfrom improved market efaciencies accrue to ITC and\nare used to defray the cost of capital investment. If\nthe sanchalaks's commission of 0.5% were to be the\nonly source of revenue used in the model, then the\nsustainability of the entire operation would become\nquestionable.\nThis section, including Tables 3, 4, and 5, outlines\nthe overall investment made by ITC-IBD to set up\nthe choupals. Each choupal consists of a multimedia\ncomputer, a printer, and an uninterrupted power\nsupply with solar backup. Connectivity to some\nplaces is provided through VSATs (Very Small Aper\nture Terminals). Research suggests that for both\npower and Internet charges, costs for solar photo\nvoltaic (PV) power and wireless connectivity will in\ncur lower recurring operating costs as compared to\ngrid power sources and wire line connectivity. Best\nand Maclay (2002) argue that the savings in operat\ning costs will make up for the added capital costs\nwhen amortized over a period of years. ITC seems\nto have adopted this strategy in pursuing the instal\nlation of solar panels and VSATs for power and\nInternet connectivity. While current capital and oper\nating cost estimates cannot demonstrate reduced\noverall costs, given that wire line connectivity and\ngrid power are highly unreliable in the region, ITC's\nproposition seems to make good business sense.25\nThe company estimates the average cost of the en\n24. The sanchalak acts as a bridge between the farmer and the technology: he provides information to farmers, sends\ntheir queries and concerns to ITC, aggregates their requirements for the purchase of agricultural inputs and consumer\nproducts, and physically handles goods through the choupal, that is, stores and distributes these goods. Many\nsanchalaks go along with farmers to the processing plants to ensure a smooth experience for arst-timers.\n25. Using wire line connectivity and grid power sources would reduce initial capital costs, but the downtime of these\nsources would be much greater in the long run. This would increase the downtime of the eChoupal (thus causing loss\nof potential revenue) and adding costs such as the use of a portable generator.\nVolume 2, Number 1, Fall 2004\n\neCHOUPALS\nTable 3.

There are about 2,000 rural ex\nchanges in Madhya Pradesh, of which 256 were providing modem connectivity to ITC's initial set of\nsoyachoupals, but they needed to be upgraded to allow for data transfer. ITC started the upgrade pro\ncess in June 2001 by installing 130 RNS kits on behalf of the public telecom company Bharat Sanchar\nNigam Ltd. (BSNL). BSNL reimbursed the value of the RNS kits at current market price in 2002 causing\nITC to incur a loss. ITC also had to bear the manpower costs for installation. The hardware cost is Rs.\n12,000 and software cost is Rs. 3,000 per exchange. In the next year, BSNL bought all the hardware and\nsoftware for 140 more kits that were installed by ITC personnel. ITC had to bear the operating expenses\nfor these installations. This has made dial-up connectivity possible in 240 more villages apart from the\n100 that already have VSATs.\nthis calculation).

The operating costs incurred for\ndaily trading, buying from commission agents, exporting, and running the main oface are not included\nsince they would have been borne by ITC regardless of the investment made in the choupals.\n2Rs. 418,841 has been obtained by dividing the sum of operating costs from April 2002 until December\n2002 (9 months) by 9. The total for 9 months (Rs. 3,769,568) was provided by Raghav Jhawar, anance\nmanager, ITC-Bhopal. It includes 5 months from Year 1 (Sep 2001-Aug 2002) and 4 months from Year 2\n(Sep 2002-Dec 2002).\n3The AMC estimate seems unusually low--only about Rs. 900 per choupal per year. Another estimate of\noperating costs given to the author was Rs. 1,000 per choupal per month making the total operating\ncost approximately Rs. 9,552,000. If we subtract the bandwidth and operating expenditure from this\nnumber, we can obtain an estimate of the AMC (assuming these are the only three operating costs). This\nnumber is Rs. 2,425,908 or approximately Rs. 3,000 per choupal per year. However, using Rs. 9,522,000\nas the total operating cost would increase the operating cost used in the calculations by about 20%; but\nas the revenues are nearly ave times the operating costs on average, the reduction in net proat will be\nonly about 5%. Thus, the difference to the overall sustainability of the choupals will not be very large.\nTraveling and Staff Welfare\n63,376\nVehicles\n16,965\nStationery\n20,414\nManager's Expenses\n20,050\nCommunication Costs\n21,773\nLand Rent\n65,000\nTraining\n39,882\nMiscellaneous\n1,590\nTotal for December\n24,9050\n1The information for this table was provided by Raghav Jhawar, anance manager, ITC Bhopal.\n2The amount for December is low compared with data for other months, which ranged as high as\nRs. 4-8 million. This may be due to reducing levels of procurement as the soybean season's peak ends,\nor perhaps not many new choupals were established at this time.\n(proatability to allow replacement of worn-out\nequipment) to check for the robustness of the calcu\nlations on proatability. Six scenarios are developed in\nTable 6 ranging from extremely pessimistic to fairly\noptimistic based on the following assumptions.\nFirst, the eChoupal investment bears high risk be\ncause the revenue is completely dependent on the\noutput of agricultural commodities (in this case, soy\nbean), which is dependent on rainfall. This is already\nevident from the data on revenue where the pro\ncurement in Year 2 is very low (even though 796\nchoupals were installed) as compared to Year 1\n(when only 460 choupals had been established). The\narst year was a relatively normal year for monsoons\n(though not very good) and the second was practi\ncally a drought year, which signiacantly reduced the\nsoybean output. The calculations for the return on\ninvestment take this risk into account by assigning\nInformation Technologies and International Development\n\nprobabilities to rainfall failure. Two scenarios are an\nalyzed: one with a 50% probability of rainfall failure\nover the course of the project and one with a 20%\nprobability of failure. The 50% probability, which is\nan extremely pessimistic and highly conservative\nchoice, has been used to see whether ITC's invest\nment turns out to have a reasonable payback period\neven under such adverse conditions. If yes, then the\npotential for proatability is much greater.\nSecond, the opportunity cost of the money in\nvested in the eChoupals must be accounted for in\nthis analysis. Usually the opportunity cost of capital\n(OCC) is the amount (or percentage) of interest that\nwill be foregone if the capital had been invested in a\nbank deposit or treasury bonds or even the stock\nmarket. Each of these OCC values depends on the\ninterest rate given by the bank or the Treasury but it\nalso includes a risk rate. In other words, while a\naxed deposit might give an interest rate of 6%, the\nstock market will usually give returns around 15%\nbecause of the inherent risks of the venture. Thus,\nthe OCC is a cumulative interest rate that includes a\nsavings rate as well as a risk rate. Since this project\nis quite risky (because of its dependence on the\nmonsoon), we assume at least 10% (6% savings\nrate plus a 4% risk rate) as a realistic opportunity\ncost of capital. The value of any proat obtained on\nthis investment has to be discounted by the OCC\nrate to account for this foregone interest. However,\nto perform a sensitivity analysis to incorporate lower\nand higher risk than 10%, two other values of\nOCC--6% (very safe investment) and 20% (very\nrisky investment)--have also been used in\ncalculations.\nThird, it is important to keep enough money\naside from the revenue that comes in to replace\ncomputers and VSATs once they reach their life\nspan. It is acknowledged that due to pressures\nwithin the technology industry to innovate, change\nproducts and speciacations, and sell new technolo\ngies, ICT equipment changes rapidly. Generally, the\nneeds and demands of users of ICT equipment\nchange much more slowly (Cisler, 2002). Thus, it is\nunknown whether this equipment will have to be\nreplaced over the course of 5 years or 10 years, and\nKUMAR\ndepending on which depreciation period is chosen,\nthe proatability of the investment differs signia\ncantly. While the percentage recommended by In\ndian government authorities for tax write-off pur\nposes for computer equipment is 60% per annum\nfrom October 2002 onward,26 this paper conducts\nan analysis based on two variables of 15% (7-year\ndepreciation) and 20% (5-year depreciation) as a\nconservative estimate, as we are trying to assess ac\ntual replacement needs over time.\nTables 6.1 through 6.6 provide a comprehensive\nanancial analysis of the data on revenue and costs.\nTable 6.1 calculates net income (proat) and two\nrates of return on investment. Table 6.2 includes the\nprobability of monsoon failure and provides two\nweighted rates of return on investment that are\nused to calculate future streams of proat in Table\n6.3. Table 6.4a and 6.4b calculate the present values\nof investment and proat after each year (for a total\nof 7 years) using three rates of the opportunity cost\nof capital to enable comparison for the anal calcula\ntion of net present value of the investment and the\npayback period.\nTable 6.5 provides the calculations of the net\npresent value (NPV) of the investment from Year 4\nto Year 7 to see how long it takes to recover the ini\ntial investment (net present value becomes positive)\nusing the three OCC rates. At the point where the\nNPV is zero, the project has completely paid for it\nself. The amount of time taken for this is known as\nthe payback period. As the OCC rate rises (from 6%\nto 10% to 20%), it takes longer for the project to\nachieve a positive NPV and the payback period in\ncreases. Similarly, using the 50% rainfall failure sce\nnario, the payback period is much longer as\ncompared with using the 20% failure rate.\nThe most realistic scenario is a payback period of\n3.9 years with an OCC of 10% and probability of\nmonsoon failure at 20%. However, even in the\nworst case scenario with an OCC rate of 20% and a\n50% rainfall failure probability, the payback period\nis 5.8 years. The project does seem to be anancially\nsustainable, but the analysis so far has not included\nthe cost of depreciation. The project will have to re\nplace capital equipment (computers and other\n26.

Visit http://\nwww.helplinelaw.com/news/1002/d_deprate1002.php for the amendment to the Income Tax Act, which states that\ncomputers as a separate category are entitled to depreciation at 60% per annum since October 2002.\nVolume 2, Number 1, Fall 2004\n\neCHOUPALS\nhardware) as it gets obsolete or breaks down over\nthe course of the 7-year period. Can the proats sus\ntain this new investment at repeated intervals? Table\n6.6 compares the cost of re-investment at the end\nof 5 years and 7 years with the NPV of the project.\nAt the end of a given number of years, the value of\nthe NPV is the amount available to be re-invested in\nreplacing equipment at that time. It is clear that only\nin the most optimistic scenario using 6% OCC and\n20% monsoon failure is there sufacient money left\nover at the end of 7 years to pay for replacement\ncosts entirely. In the realistic scenario of 10% OCC\nand 20% monsoon failure, about 83% of replace\nment costs can be covered at the end of 7 years but\nonly 31.5% can be covered at the end of 5 years.\nWhile this means that the overall proatability of the\nproject is reduced, the discussion in the next section\nanalyzes other sources of revenue that could help\nthe project achieve long-term sustainability.\nThe calculations in Tables 6.1-6.6 give us a static\nanancial picture at the end of December 2002,\nwhereby ITC-IBD, with no further investment and no\nchanges in operations over time, would recover its\ncosts within 3.9 to 5.8 years, depending on the as\nsumptions used. However, the proatability of the\nproject in the calculations has only used revenue\nagures from soybean procurement. ITC-IBD had al\nready initiated the procurement of wheat from the\nchoupals in Year 1 and was gearing up for massive\nbuying in the months from January to April 2002.27\nThe addition of revenue from wheat would change\nthe calculations signiacantly, given that wheat is a\nlarger tonnage crop in Madhya Pradesh compared\nto soybean.28 Even more important, the choupals\nhad become distribution centers for a variety of ag\nricultural and consumer products like seeds, pesti\ncides, fertilizers, soybean oil, and even insurance.\nThe commission accruing to ITC-IBD from these\nsales is potentially signiacant, but it is unknown and\ntherefore has not been included in the calculations.\nClearly, since the eChoupals have only been in full\noperation for less than 2 years, and since potential\nrevenue from wheat procurement and input sales\ncould be substantial, the possibility for payback in\n3.9 years using the soybean data alone gives\nconadence that the choupals are well on their way\nto anancial sustainability.\nSeveral cautionary notes are in order. ITC-IBD it\nself suggests that the savings from transaction costs\nand quality improvement will decrease over time\nand die out in a few years because of increased\nefaciencies in the market and greater competition\nfrom middlemen and other companies.29 Instead,\nITC's expectation of a long-term source of revenue is\nnot primarily from procurement but from the sale of\nconsumer goods and agricultural inputs. Since this\nevaluation of sustainability is based on a linear ex\ntrapolation for 7 years, if these transaction savings\ngo down, sustainability will be negatively impacted.\nAnd since there is no data yet available for commis\nsion revenues from rural distribution of agricultural\ninputs and consumer goods, it cannot be said for\ncertain how the project will shape up in the future.\nNext, there are questions with the quality data\nused as part of the savings calculations in Table 2. In\nthe arst year, apart from conducting laboratory sam\nple tests, ITC ran a batch of eChoupal soybean and\nregular soybean through its processing plant in\nIndore. Data on the quantity of soybean tested, de\ntailed percentage breakdown of quality improve\nment, margins of error, and the method used to\nobtain numerical values for savings are not available.\nThe data for Year 2 are signiacantly lower and are\nbased only on laboratory sample testing. Using the\narst year's percentage of 1.78% savings, the savings\nfrom quality in Year 2 increased by 4 times com\npared with the actual value of Rs. 3 million. While\nthere have been improvements in quality, they could\nfall within the range of 0.5% to 2.0% of the price\nof soybean bought. This is a very large range, and\nunfortunately, more precise data were not available.\nFinally, and this is the most important, most of\n27. January is the start of the wheat harvest and most farmers sell their produce within 4 months of the harvest.\n28.

Already ITC's competitor companies like Ruchi Soya and Savariya Soya have set up their own computer centers in\nsome villages and are on a massive advertising campaign to attract farmers with higher prices and value-added services\nlike pick-up from home. Local traders in small towns have also responded by opening branches closer to villages and\nvillage traders have been forced to quote a higher price even to very small farmers lest the latter go to the choupal\nand sell the material to the sanchalak (who amalgamates these 1-2 bag sales and takes them together to ITC).\nInformation Technologies and International Development\n\nKUMAR\nTables 6.1 to 6.6.

The cash oow values in this table are all nominal (not\ndiscounted for inoation) and will be discounted in Table 6.4 for using different nominal rates of interest\nfor the calculation of net present value and payback period.\n2The revenue agures come from Table 2, Column O. The agures do not include anticipated revenue from\nthe procurement of wheat or sale of inputs.\n3Operating costs come from Table 5. The agure in Table 5 is a cumulative annual cost for 796 choupals\n(Rs. 7,786,092). In the arst year, only 460 choupals were in operation, hence this agure has been ad\njusted linearly to reoect fewer numbers of choupals. For the second year, even though 796 choupals\nwere in operation, our data is only for 4 months. Hence the overall number from Table 5 is discounted\nfor 4 months.\n4Net income (proat) has been calculated using the simple formula Proat Revenue Operating Costs\nfor Year 1 and Year 2.\n5Proat is divided by investment in Years 1 and 2 separately to obtain two annual rates of return on in\nvestment (ROI). The ROI in Year 1 is designated as a Good Rain Year ROI (GRY) while the ROI in Year 2 is\ndesignated as a Bad Rain Year ROI (BRY).\nTable 6.2 Calculation of Rate of Return on Investment Using Factor Probability of\nMonsoons in India1\nEvery Other Year (50%)\nWeighted ROI = (GRY2 0.5)\n30.66%\n(BRY3 0.5)\n1 in 5 Years (20%)\nWeighted ROI (GRY 0.80)\n38.83%\n(BRY 0.20)\n1The rate of return on investment is adjusted using a factor of probability of the monsoons to obtain an\naverage annual rate of return that can be used to calculate future values of proat. An extremely conser\nvative estimate assumes a 50% chance of monsoon failure, thus weighting the ROI from Year 1 and\nYear 1 equally. A more realistic estimate assumes monsoon failure at 20%, or once in 5 years.\n2GRY = Good Rain Year.\n3BRY = Bad Rain Year.\nVolume 2, Number 1, Fall 2004\n\neCHOUPALS\nInformation Technologies and International Development\nYear 1 Actual Proat\n21,750,500\n21,750,500\nYear 2 Actual Proat\n12,904,636\n12,904,636\nYear 3 Estimated Proat\n24,140,244\n30,571,898\nYear 4 Estimated Proat\n25,105,854\n31,794,774\n26,110,088\n33,066,565\n27,154,492\n34,389,227\n28,240,671\n35,764,796\n1This weighted rate of return on investment is used to calculate constant future streams of proat for\n7 years. This is done by adding the total investment made in Year 1 and Year 2 and multiplying this by\nthe weighted ROI. The estimated proats from Years 3 to 7 are adjusted for inoation, since this is a nomi-\nnal value.\nTo calculate inoation rate, the Wholesale Price Index has been obtained from \"The Consumer Price In-\ndex Numbers for Industrial Workers--All-India (Base: 1982 100)\" table available at the Reserve Bank of\nIndia website http://www.rbi.org.in/index.dll/34044?OpenStoryTextArea?fromdate\n06/30/97&todate\n03/\n12/03&s1secid\n70&s2secid\n0&secid\n2/70/0&archivemode\n2).

This agure will be used to calculate Net\nPresent Value of the investment (by subtracting it from the Present Value of cumulative proats) at the\nend of a given number of years.\n2The Opportunity Cost of Capital (OCC) must be taken into account when calculating the present value\nof any investment. To perform a sensitivity analysis, three values of OCC--6% (very safe investment),\n10% (risky investment), and 20% (very risky investment)--have been used in calculations in Tables 6.4a\nand 6.4b. The OCC rate is also called the discount rate.\nThe Fixed Deposit Savings rate of ICICI Bank is 6% and has been used as the baseline savings rate for\ndiscounting. See www.bankoandia.com/interest_rates.html and www.icicibank.com/pfsuser/icicibank/\ndepositproducts/axeddeposits/interestrates.htm which provide axed deposit interest rates for deposits of\nmore than Rs. 10 million for more than 1 year at 5.50% per annum and 6.0% per annum.\n3Investment in Year 1 is made at the start of the year, that is, Time (t) = 0. Thus, it is not discounted.\n4Investment in Year 2 has been made at t\n1 (or at the start of the second year) so it is discounted only\nfor one year (and not 16 months) to get its Present Value in t\n0.\n\nVolume 2, Number 1, Fall

Thus, the savings calcu\nlated do not reoect the returns on investment from\nICTs.30 In this project, ICTs are a catalyst for (or an\ninstrument of) the process of improving transaction\noows by disintermediating and bringing efaciencies\ninto the agricultural value chain. The resultant sav\nings are not a direct result of the technology, which\nwas not in general use at all. Rather, efaciencies im\nproved because the process of information ex\nchange resulting from introducing the technology\nled to the rationalization of production oows. Thus,\nit is not the computers, email, and Internet that are\ngenerating these savings but the elimination of\ninefaciencies from the market. Technology is a cata\nlyst for another process, which is social and eco\nnomic, and to argue that all this has been because\nof computers would not be accurate.31\nThis paper has not attempted to outline or evaluate\nthe impact of the soyachoupals on their primary us\ners, namely the farmers in rural Madhya Pradesh. In\nthe author's interviews at the village level, it became\napparent that caste afaliations, political alignments,\nand even the size of one's farm were important is\nsues that inouenced access to the eChoupals and\ndetermined to what extent farmer incomes were\nchanging. Moreover, eChoupals had only been es\ntablished in larger and more prosperous villages so\ntheir reach into the poorer and remoter parts of ru\nral India is still an open question. Concerns were\nalso raised regarding the possible market monopoly\nby ITC-IBD in the future, given that the alternative\nmandi system and local traders were losing market\nshare and their business was being greatly threat\nened.32 While recognizing the limitations of this pa\nper in leaving out these important social, economic,\npolitical, and cultural issues, the author concentrates\non anancial sustainability because without it, the\nproject would close down and there would be no\nquestion of studying impact on the people.\nITC-IBD is itself convinced of the sustainability\nand scalability of the eChoupal model. It recently\nadopted an ambitious 5-year plan to establish\n20,000 choupals in the country. It seeks to modify\nand reane the eChoupal model as it expands into\nother states and starts buying other crops. There are\nseveral challenges. First, ITC itself believes that the\nproatability of the choupals will diminish over time\nbecause the information revolution of the\neChoupals cannot be conaned to the choupals\nalone. Other companies have already picked up the\nprocess of rationalization and disintermediation, but\nITC is prepared for continuous changes of its system\nof information delivery and potential competition is\npart of company planning. Second, despite a sensi\ntivity analysis and obtaining a range of payback peri\nods, the analysis of anancial sustainability in this\npaper is based on limited availability of data and\ncontains a signiacant amount of extrapolation to the\nfuture. This needs to be taken into consideration\nwhen one examines the results. Third, the project is\nrunning on the basis of enthusiastic, talented people\nwho have taken it upon themselves to ensure its\nsuccess. The cost of their time and energy, especially\nsince the choupal responsibility is in addition to their\nregular work of export trading and procurement, is\nnot included in these calculations. This omission be\ncomes crucial as the company expands and more\n30. ITC argues that transactions have been higher from eChoupals with satellite connectivity compared with eChoupals\nwithout satellite connectivity (or no connectivity at all), implying that the presence of a connected computer made a\nsigniacant difference in encouraging farmers to try out the new system. However, several factors are involved in deter\nmining activity levels of choupals, including the distance from processing plants, choice of operator (sanchalak) and his\nentrepreneurial ability, level of soybean harvest, etc., making it difacult to isolate the impact of connectivity alone.\n31. This brings up an interesting question: Is the telephone sufacient to produce these kinds of market efaciencies? In\nother words, would investment in call centers be more \"appropriate\" on the part of ITC rather than expensive comput\ners and VSATs? Most of the interviewees at ITC-IBD pointed out the unique ability of transmitting volumes of informa\ntion to a number of places through computers and the Internet, especially when it came to providing information on\nbest practices and setting up consultancy with remote agricultural scientists. Further research into the costs and\nbeneats of both these technologies (it has not been undertaken as part of this study) will be useful to explore the\nvalue-added by high-end ICTs and perhaps justify the popular deployment of computers as the technology of choice.\n32. These are critical questions and the author hopes to address them in a forthcoming paper.\nInformation Technologies and International Development\n\nKUMAR\npeople are recruited to handle larger numbers of\neChoupals. ITC is aware of the challenge to main\ntain the initial level of enthusiasm and to train new\npeople to align with their vision as they move to\nward 20,000 choupals. Internal training sessions and\na knowledge management system, while in place,\nare yet to be fully implemented at the aeld level to\ncollectively pool the learning of many aeld workers\nin the expansion process.\nDespite all these challenges, what is impressive is\nthat after 16 months of operation, the eChoupal\nproject seems to be not only self-sustaining, but in\nfact, proatable. A number of factors promise to\nkeep it self-sustaining. Already, there are ongoing\nefforts to use the choupals to procure additional\ncrops in the yearly crop cycle and for bulk sale of\ncheaper agricultural inputs. Both activities propose\nto beneat farmers and to help ensure year-round\ntransactions and commissions for ITC and the opera\ntors. Second, with additional training and by remov\ning connectivity hurdles, the computers installed in\nthe villages will be used to conduct these transac\ntions, thus introducing new economies of scale.\nMoreover, ITC believes that computers will play a vi\ntal role in disseminating agricultural best practice in\nformation and connecting farmers to agricultural\nscientists for consultancy--an ambitious aim to en\ncourage higher farm productivity and improve the\noverall competitiveness of Indian agriculture. Third,\nITC has long-term plans to use this network for the\nsale of other products, such as motorbikes and in\nsurance, which entails a commission to the com\npany. And anally, given a computer network of\n20,000 nodes, there are possibilities of using this in\nfrastructure to disseminate noncommercial informa\ntion to rural areas more effectively. All these are\npositive elements on the side of ITC that will\nstrengthen the sustainability of the eChoupals.\nThe data presented here and the promise of the\nfuture have prompted India's largest agri-exporter to\nmake a huge investment in this previously untried\nand untested domain. With dedicated and enthusi\nastic personnel, with a desire to learn from mistakes,\nand with a clear vision, the eChoupals may become\nthe largest successful ICT initiative in India. It is es\nsential, however, that this research is placed within\nthe context of the larger debate on ICTs and devel\nopment. For that, further studies are required to un\nderstand the impact of the eChoupals on the lives\nof rural women, small and medium-sized farms, ag\nricultural laborers, lower castes, and the destitute,\nespecially as the eChoupals expand to cover much\nof India. Only then will it be possible to understand\nto what extent ICTs can contribute to changing the\nlife of the rural poor in the long run. ■\nI am grateful for the openness and cooperation of\nS. Sivakumar and his team in Hyderabad--V. V.\nRajasekhar, Rajnikant Rai, and K. T. Prasad--and I\nprofusely thank them for taking valuable time to dis\ncuss the eChoupal model and for encouraging me\nin my research. I would also like to thank G. N.\nMurthy and his team in ITC-Bhopal--D. V. Ram\nkumar, Chander Mohan, and Prashant Mishra--for\norganizing my aeld visits and for their willingness to\nmake available local data. Their conversations with\nme were frank and forthcoming, both in their dis\ncussion of the learning process behind the imple\nmentation of such a large ICT initiative, as well as in\ntheir acknowledgement of the many challenges and\nproblems that lie ahead in scaling up and making\nthe centers work in the long run. I am indebted to\nRaghav Jhawar of ITC-Bhopal for spending several\nhours patiently explaining to me the anancial model\nof the eChoupals and for corresponding with me to\nclarify the numbers. Finally, without the welcoming\nreception by choupal operators and villagers, as well\nas the support of several ITC staff members, this\nstudy would not have happened.\nThe Kelly Douglas Fund and the Department of\nScience, Technology and Society at MIT provided\npartial funding for my research and I express my\nthanks to them. The meticulous and detailed com\nments of an anonymous reviewer for ITID contrib\nuted to strengthening the anancial analysis as well\nas the argument in this paper and I express my\nheartfelt gratitude.

However, success sto\nries of speech interfaces in developing regions are few and far between. The\nchallenges of literacy, dialectal variation, and the prohibitive expense of creat\ning the necessary linguistic resources are intractable using traditional tech\nniques. We present our andings evaluating a low-cost, scalable speech-driven\napplication designed and deployed in a community center in rural Tamil Nadu,\nIndia, to disseminate agricultural information to village farmers.\nSpeech interfaces, or spoken dialog systems (SDS), allow users to control\ncomputer output (graphics, texts, or audio) by uttering key words or\nphrases that are interpreted using automatic speech recognition (ASR).\nSuccessful speech interfaces can accommodate the sight- or mobility-\nimpaired by replacing or enhancing access to the computer output\n(screen) and input (keyboard, mouse) (Raman, 1997). Automated tele\nphony systems are commercially available and are commonly used by busi\nnesses to reduce call center costs, as they are relatively affordable to run,\nonce built. The main hurdle in replicating this success for the access of\ncomputing technologies in the developing world so far has been the pro\nhibitive cost of computing devices, IT infrastructure, and designs for soft\nware and hardware that assume literacy and computer savvy (Brewer et\nal., 2006). Cell phones are affordable, the infrastructure they require is\nmore readily available, and they are used extensively throughout the de\nveloping world. Often cell phones are shared by multiple users of varying\ndegrees of literacy (Donner, 2004). Automated telephony services and\nother speech interfaces are attractive channels for information access es\npecially among the oral communities in developing regions. For example,\nmany applications for rural Indian IT that provide information on health,\nweather, employment, news, and agricultural could enhance the social\nand economic development of the rural poor (Sustainable Access in Rural\nIndia [SARI], 2005) and could be constructed around a limited-vocabulary\nspeech interface. Others who have studied the positive impacts of speech-\ndriven interfaces in developed regions, however, predict that such applica\ntions will likely not enhance the quality of life of those that rely on them\n(Jelinek, 1996).\nTo design a successful speech interface for use in rural India is to face\nconsiderable challenges. The ASR must perform in noisy environments\nwhere multilingualism and substantial dialectal variation are prevalent. The\nASR must accurately recognize speech from languages for which neither\n(c) The MIT Press 2008. Published under Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial-NoDerivativeWorks Unported 3.0 license.

The front-end dialog interface should\nbe interactive, easily adoptable, and accommodate\nindividuals who lack formal education and computer\nliteracy. The user interface (UI) will be effective only\nif it stems from a deep understanding of a commu\nnity culture and value systems. However, design\ntechniques developed for accessing sociocultural\nmodels in relatively wealthy European and North\nAmerican communities are ineffective in poor com\nmunities, where leisure and formal education are\nspare. Finally, a successful speech interface is one\nthat supports an application based on local content\ncreated by local providers, as the information needs\nof rural communities include news, events, and in\nnovations happening within a radius of only a few\nkilometers.\nA speech driven application for developing com\nmunities must address all of these issues in order to\nsuccessfully extend IT access to the developing\nworld. This article offers design requirements and\nsolutions for the local content creation, ASR, and UI\nfor speech interfaces in developing regions. We eval\nuate our solutions through a participatory design\nand deployment effort in which we collaborated\nwith community partners to provide interactive agri\ncultural information to rural villagers in southern\nIndia.\nRelevant, local content is a large concern for devel\noping regions (Chisenga, 1999). Attempts by local\nor national government or nongovernmental organi\nzations to provide free, locally available health, job\ntraining, and education services that meet the basic\nneeds of the public often do not reach unschooled\npopulations in an accessible, reliable form. Radio\nand TV are affordable forms of mass media that can\nbe effective at creating initial public awareness.\nHowever, they are much less effective in inouencing\npeople to improve their practices in health, agricul\nture, or education than traditional, oral methods of\ninformation dissemination that stem from within a\ncommunity (Soola, 1988).\nHistorically, society has seldom given poor people\nownership over the tools of production (Castells,\n1997; Gordo, 2003). However, researchers in the\naeld of IT for developing regions agree that involv\ning community members in design and creation en\nsures that proposed solutions meet the needs of the\ncommunity and provide the best chance for the\nsustainability of technology in a community (Braund\n& Schwittay, 2006). IT offers the opportunity and in\nfrastructure for publishing and distributing all types\nof information in the shortest possible time and at\nthe lowest cost. In particular, IT can be used by com\nmunity partners to provide accurate, locally created\ninformation to unschooled adults in developing\nregions.\nIn rural Tamil Nadu, 37.47% of full-time workers\nand 71.64% of marginal workers work in the agri\ncultural sector--a majority of them small cultivators\nor seasonal laborers (Figure 1). Across all developing\nregions of the world, farmers and other agricultural\nworkers constitute over 40% of the labor force. The\ninformation needs of farmers in developing regions\nare likely to be vast and varied. Although the ability\nand inclination to base sale decisions on price infor\nmation is open to question (Hornik, 1988; Blattman,\nRoman, & Jensen, 2003), studies have suggested\nthat under the right circumstances, price and market\ninformation can improve farmer welfare (Eggleston,\nJensen, & Zeckhauser, 2002; Prahalad & Hammond,\n2002). Information on recommended techniques\n(pest and disease prevention, new seeds) improve\nproduction (Blattman, Roman & Jensen, 2003) and\nIT-based information networks can help raise the\nprice of goods sold for small farmers (Kumar, 2004).\nMS Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) is\nan established nongovernmental organization (NGO)\nin Tamil Nadu dedicated to a pro-nature, pro-poor,\nFigure 1. Rural farmers in the Povalamkottai village\nplaza, Tamil Nadu.\nInformation Technologies and International Development\n\nPLAUCHE, NALLASAMY\nFigure 2. MS Swaminathan Research Foundation village centers.\nand pro-women approach to fostering economic\ngrowth in rural, agricultural areas. Gathering and\ndistributing accurate information for unschooled ag\nricultural workers is central to MSSRF's efforts.\nTrained community members in villages across\nsouthern India operate MSSRF village knowledge\ncenters (VKCs), where they provide the rural poor\nwith training and education on agricultural prac\ntices, health, social issues, and entrepreneurial devel\nopment. The trained volunteers from each\ncommunity, known as \"knowledge workers,\" regu\nlarly communicate the needs of their neighbors to\nvillage resource centers (VRCs) through weekly\nmeetings, a user registry, and door-to-door surveys.\nThe VRCs, in turn, communicate needs to MSSRF\nheadquarters (Chennai, Tamil Nadu), where informa\ntion content (text, audio, video), additional training,\nvideo conferencing, and workshops are provided to\naddress the needs of communities across the state.\nOur project was conducted in collaboration with\nSempatti VRC, which is responsible for 9 VKCs in\nthe region (Figure 2), each one serving between\n2,000 and 11,000 people.\nIn addition to bridging knowledge between com\nmunities and MSSRF headquarters, the agricultural\nexperts at VRCs meticulously document the crops\ngrown in the region, including varieties, planting\ntechniques, soil properties and fertilizers. VRCs func\ntion as regional libraries for the rural illiterate per\nson, as they contain a wealth of short videos\nprepared locally by universities and community orga-\nVolume 4, Number 1, Fall 2007\nFigure 3. Daily postings of weather, news, and market\nprices at the Sempatti VRC.\nnizations on recommended agricultural and health\npractices. In addition, video conferences conducted\nbetween VRCs allow farmer groups or self-help\ngroups to communicate experiences and local inno\nvations across districts of Tamil Nadu using tradi\ntional, oral techniques.\nInformation from VKCs, VRCs, and headquarters\nis consolidated, digitized, and disseminated through\nout MSSRF centers by phone, dial-up voice transfer,\nor wi-a. Villagers may access accurate, up-to-date\ninformation at a nearby VKC by reading posted bul\nletins (Figure 3), listening to loudspeaker broadcasts,\nor working one-on-one with a knowledge worker\n(Balaji, et al., 2004). Knowledge workers often refer\nto a static, text-based HTML page called Valam (a\n\nSPEECH INTERFACES FOR EQUITABLE ACCESS TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\nFigure 4. Valam (\"Resources\") Website available in all MSSRF centers.\nTamil word meaning resources) to retrieve locally rel\nevant information on health, education, jobs,\nmicrocredit, self-help groups, and agriculture (Figure\n4).\nMSSRF staff in all three districts we visited re\nported a need to disseminate information in a form\naccessible to their predominantly oral population. In\nSempatti, knowledge workers reported much suc\ncess in educating illiterate people using a touch\nscreen kiosk, called the Livestock Guru (Heffernan,\n2006). A major limitation to the tool, however, was\nits inability to be modiaed and updated. Throughout\nthe design and evaluation of our technology, we re\nlied on the experience of MSSRF staff in spreading\nrelevant information across rural communities and\nadopted their belief that each village center is both\na destination and a source for rich knowledge and\ninformation. Finally, the success of our project owes\nmuch to MSSRF's trusted role in the rural communi\nties in which we designed and evaluated our\ntechnology.\nASR is the process of algorithmically converting a\nspeech signal (audio) into a sequence of words\n(text). Although vendors of commercial systems and\nspeech researchers often report the ability to cor\nrectly identify words from speech around 95% of\nthe time, these numbers corre\nspond to performance under\noptimal conditions (quiet, con\ntrolled environment, limited do\nmain, single speaker). However,\nASR is a nontrivial task because\nof the inanite variations of speech\nand will fail miserably in more\nchallenging conditions (cocktail\nparty, overlapping speech, etc.).\nState-of-the-art speech recogniz\ners perform at only 80% on the\nSwitchboard corpus, for example,\na collection of near-natural, con\ntinuous speech recorded from\nmultiple speakers during human-\nto-human telephone conversa\ntions. ASR decodes words from\nan audio signal by training hidden\nMarkov models (HMMs) for\nphones, diphones, or triphones based on training\ndata, generally a large corpus of speech that is\nhand-labeled at the phoneme or word level (Figure\n5). ASR success depends on the collection and an\nnotation of this training data, as well as the creation\nof a dictionary of all possible words in the language\nwith all possible pronunciations for each word. A\nlarge vocabulary ASR also relies on language-level\nconstraints captured by a language model either\ntrained on a large text corpus or grammar rules me\nticulously created by a linguist. The creation of these\nlinguistic resources (training data--speech, text and\npronunciation dictionary) is arguably the most costly\nprocess of ASR development.\nThe availability of linguistic resources is taken for\ngranted by developers who work in English, French,\nand Japanese, for example. The majority of the\nworld's 6,000 languages, which are spoken in devel\noping regions, currently have no associated linguistic\nresources. In India, there are two ofacial languages\n(Hindi and English), 22 scheduled languages (includ\ning Tamil), and an estimated 400 more (Ethnologue\n2006). The prohibitive cost of creating linguistic re\nsources hinders the development of speech technol\nogies for languages like Tamil, which is spoken by\nmore than 60 million people in Tamil Nadu, Sri\nLanka, and elsewhere (Ethnologue 2006). Equitable\naccess to IT requires support for all languages, re-\nInformation Technologies and International Development\n\nPLAUCHE, NALLASAMY\nSpeech recordings of rural villag\ners in three districts of Tamil Nadu\nwere conducted in 2004 and\n2005 to create adequate training\ndata for machine recognition of a\nsmall vocabulary (less than 100\nwords) of isolated Tamil words. In\nthe following sections, we evalu\nate the performance of a small\nTamil word recognizer in the face\nof dialectal variation and limited\ntraining data. We focus on a rec\nognition task that is relatively sim\nple, yet adequate to power an\nSDS. In addition, we discuss the\nchallenges of collecting speech\ndata from unschooled adults and\nFigure 5.

As a re\nsult, of the three basic principles to speech recogni\ntion performance (Table 1), the arst principle, \"The\nmore data, the better,\" has dominated the direction\nof ASR research in languages with plentiful linguistic\nresources. One estimate, however, puts the amount\nof training data needed for current systems to\nachieve human levels of recognition between 3 and\n10 million hours of acoustic training data, that is be\ntween 4 and 70 human lifetimes of exposure to\nspeech (Moore 2003). The singular drive for more\ntraining data requires substantial cost, time, and ex\npertise to collect and is ill suited to ASR in develop\ning regions. In this article, we show how simplifying\nthe recognition task and adopting adaptation tech\nniques that tune the recognizer's models to match\ninput data can achieve equivalent performance to\nbetter accommodate the economic and linguistic\nconditions of developing regions.\nDuring two aeld visits, we re\ncorded the speech of 77 volun\nteers in three separate districts in Tamil Nadu, India\n(Figure 6). All volunteers were native speakers of\nTamil over the age of 18. The researchers sought a\nbalance of gender, education level, and age among\nparticipants, but the demographics of this study var\nied greatly by site (Table 2) and by recruiting\nmethod.\nCoimbatore volunteers were either undergradu\nate students at Amrita University or laborers re\ncruited by word of mouth; this method proved to be\nunsuccessful for the latter group. In Pondicherry, lit\nerate farmers and their wives were recruited as vol\nunteers by MSSRF. In Madurai district, volunteers\nwere recruited through MSSRF and Aravind eye\nTable 1. Basic Principles of Speech\nRecognition Performance\nThe more data, the better.\nThe more input matches training data, the better.\nThe simpler the task, the better.\nVolume 4, Number 1, Fall 2007\n\nSPEECH INTERFACES FOR EQUITABLE ACCESS TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\nFigure 6.

We\nfound that working alongside trusted organizations\nthat serve the rural poor was the most efacient\nmethod for recruiting and recording villagers, espe\ncially those with little or no formal education.\nTraditional data collection for small vocabulary\nspeech databases relies on read speech in a quiet,\ncontrolled setting. Recordings for this study were\nconducted in the quietest available space, which, in\nmany cases, was outdoors or in other public areas.\nEquipment and elicitation techniques varied by site;\nresearchers had to be oexible to environmental con\nditions. Initially, literate Tamil speakers in Pondicherry\n(2004) were recorded saying 30 Tamil command\nwords (e.g., \"repeat,\" \"send,\" \"next\") in relatively\nquiet ofaces with a lapel microphone or desktop mi\ncrophone and a laptop running mouse-driven soft\nware that displayed a written word and recorded\nthe speaker saying the target word.\nFigure 7. Recording a literate woman in Ettimadai,\nCoimbatore district.\nData collection in rural Tamil Nadu in 2005 relied\ninstead on oashcards and a telephone handset with\nan embedded microphone connected to a Sony MD\nWalkman (MZ-NH900) (Figure 7). This allowed the\nspeaker to comfortably hold the microphone close\nto the mouth but slightly to the side of the lips, to\navoid \"p-pops,\" bursts of high airoow during\nspeech. In addition to capturing quality speech re\ncordings in a variety of environmental conditions\n(average signal-to-noise ratio was 29), the modiaed\ntelephone handset did not require us to clip or fas\nten equipment to the speaker's clothing and did not\nrequire the use of a table.\nBilingual oashcards with digits 0-10 written in\nboth numerical and orthographic form were ran\ndomized and shown to speakers one at a time.\nSpeakers were recorded reading the numbers aloud.\nThe protocol was repeated ave times per speaker. If\na participant could not read the oashcards, a re\nsearcher or interpreter would translate the oashcards\nTable 2.

The oexible protocol provided a direct\nmethod for evaluating competency at literacy and\nnumerical literacy. Both the oashcards and anger\ncounting methods were designed to elicit single\nword utterances free from external inouences in\nword choice or pronunciation. All participants also\nanswered a questionnaire to determine linguistic\nand educational background with the aid of a local\ninterpreter.\nRecording illiterate speakers saying the words for\ndigits 0-10 took approximately six times as long as\nrecording the same data from literate speakers. This\ndiscrepancy was due to difaculties explaining the\ntask, limitations in the protocol (no reading aloud),\ninoexible and demanding occupations of partici\npants, and apprehension involving participation, re\nsulting in many missed appointments. In addition,\nilliterate speakers in this study had limited access to\ninfrastructure appropriate for recording (no housing,\nno power, public buildings) and longer social proto\ncols for foreign visitors.\nAll speech collected in Tamil Nadu was recorded at\n44 kHz, stereo, then downsampled to 16 kHz,\nmono. Each of the approximately 10,000 speech\nsamples were extracted with a collar of 100 ms of\nsilence and labeled by hand in the laboratory. A\nwhole-word recognizer was trained on the speech\nfrom 22 speakers in Pondicherry (2004) using the\nHidden Markov Toolkit (HTK). The models used 18\nstates with 6 diagonal gaussians per state. Whole\nword models were used to avoid the need for a pro\nnunciation dictionary. The following section de\nscribes various experiments to show how ASR accu\nracy depends on task complexity or vocabulary,\ndialectal variations, and amount of training data.\nThe speech collected from our aeld recordings was\ninput for recognition in three trials of varying com\nplexity: all words, digits only, and six command\nwords. As expected, word error rates dropped for\ntasks with fewer options for correct word identity\n(Figure 9). An SDS with a small vocabulary of com\nmand words, or one that limits word options at\neach node of the dialog turn would require very lit\ntle training data (less than 3 hours) to achieve accu\nrate recognition.\nMultilingualism, dialectal, and accent variations are\nprevalent in developing regions. India has 22\n\"scheduled\" (ofacial) languages but estimates range\nfrom 450 (SIL, 2005) to 850 languages (Noronha,\n2002) overall. India is the ninth most linguistically di\nverse country, with a 93% probability that any two\npeople of the country selected at random will have\ndifferent mother tongues (Ethnologue, 2006). The\nTamil language, like most languages, varies by geog\nraphy (six main dialects), social factors (caste, educa\ntion), and register (spoken vs. written). Recording\nthe words for digits in three different districts of\nTamil Nadu revealed that the pronunciation of the\nconsonant in the Tamil word for \"seven\" and the\nchoice of word for \"zero\" varied signiacantly (p\n0.01, N 385; p 0.01, N 379) by geography.\nVolume 4, Number 1, Fall 2007\n\nSPEECH INTERFACES FOR EQUITABLE ACCESS TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\nFigure 10. Word error rate for digits by site. Errors for\nthe words \"zero\" and \"seven\" are explicitly indicated.\nThe recognizer was trained on data from Pondicherry\n(2004) speakers.\nAge, gender, and education level were not predic\ntive factors in the phonetic and lexical variations.\nTo evaluate the inouence of phonetic and lexical\nvariations on a small vocabulary recognizer, we\nagain trained the recognizer on the speech of the\n22 Pondicherry (2004) speakers. Then, we tested the\nrecognizer's performance on speakers from all three\ndistricts in our study (Figure 10). Digits spoken by\nPondicherry (2005) speakers were recognized at less\nthan 2% error. Coimbatore and Madurai speakers\ncaused signiacantly higher word error rates (p\n0.01, N 3,168). These results clearly show that a\nspoken dialog system should be trained on speech\ncollected from people who are potential users of the\naelded system to ensure there are no huge varia\ntions in dialect and choice of vocabulary between\ntraining speech and the aeld data.\nRecognition performance depends largely on the\nquantity of available training data. Given that lin\nguistic resources are limited in developing regions\nand that data collection is challenging and labor in\ntensive, we ran simulations to determine the least\namount of data needed to achieve acceptable error\nrates for the operation of an SDS.\nFor each simulation, one speaker was randomly\nselected. His speech was set aside as the input\nspeech. First, the test speech was decoded by a\nrecognizer trained only on the speech of a second\nspeaker. The resulting word error rate was approxi\nmately 80% (Figure 11). Next the recognizer was\ntrained on the speech of two speakers, three speak\ners, and so on. Word error rates dropped with the\naddition of more training data. We replicated the\nexperiment under two conditions: arst, speakers\nwere added randomly from all districts; second,\nspeakers from the test speaker's district were added\narst.\nThe results show that training a simple whole-\nword recognizer on the speech of approximately 15\nspeakers results in 2% error rates or less, which\nwere found to be acceptable rates of error in paral\nlel SDS user studies (Plauche & Prabaker, 2006).\nWhen fewer than 15 speakers are available for train\ning, recognition for a given speaker is slightly better\nif trained on speakers from the same district.\nThe results from these ASR experiments conarm the\nbasic principles of ASR (Table 1). Errors decrease\nwith simple tasks, with matching input and training\ndata, and with more training\ndata. The speciac trials shown\nhere can inform our design for an\nSDS for developing regions. First,\nto achieve optimal usability with\nlimited-resource ASR, our SDS de\nsign should limit the complexity\nof the ASR task to approximately\n10 words or fewer at any given\ndialog node.\nOur main anding in recording\nthe speech of rural villagers of\nTamil Nadu is that traditional data\ncollection techniques favor liter\nate speakers and that villagers\nonly 300 kilometers apart use dif-\nInformation Technologies and International Development\nFigure 11. Word error rate by amount of training data.\n\nferent words and different pronunciations for every\nday concepts that are difacult to predict in advance.\nA speech recognizer designed to recognize the word\nchoice and pronunciation of users in one village will\nlikely fail for villagers a few hundred kilometers\naway. Likewise, the relevance of information varies\nfrom region to region (e.g., tide and sea conditions\non the coast, rainwater collection in dry regions),\nnecessitating a different set of command words in\neach case.\nOur second proposal is the integration of speech\ncollection into the SDS design. By recording the\nspeech of people while they use the SDS, we can\nensure that input and training data match not only\nin dialect, but also in other nonlinguistic factors,\nsuch as channel and room acoustics. In addition, the\ntime-consuming, artiacial step of collecting training\ndata by recording disjointed instances of speech,\nwhich is particularly ill suited to an illiterate popula\ntion, would be unnecessary. By integrating data col\nlection into the SDS, the needs of the user (gaining\naccess to relevant information) and the needs of the\nsystem (gathering instances of speech to enable rec\nognition) are simultaneously met.\nFinally, the ASR for each village could achieve ad\nequate accuracy for SDS usability by cheaply and\nquickly initializing the models with the speech of\nonly 15 speakers. In a later section, we will discuss\nlanguage adaptation techniques that can further im\nprove ASR performance when limited training data\nare available by (semi-) automatically incorporating\nuser speech into acoustic models.\nThe UI component is as important to the success of\nan SDS as ASR accuracy and application content.\nThe human-computer interaction community offers\nthese two guidelines for UI design of interactive sys\ntems (Del Galdo & Neilsen, 1996): 1. Let users feel\nin charge, not at the mercy of the system. 2. Spare\nusers as much effort as possible.\nAn appropriate and effective user interface is one\nthat suits the task to be accomplished. According to\nLansdale and Ormerod (1994), question and answer\ninterfaces work well when the user need only pro\nvide a small amount of information (cash machine).\nRepetitive tasks and tasks in which the user must\nprovide a large amount of information before a sys\ntem action can take place, are best served by form\nalling tasks (calendars, travel). One strength of form-\nPLAUCHE, NALLASAMY\nalling tasks is that they are compatible with paper-\nbased forms (health surveys, land deed requests).\nMenus allow the user to choose from a set of op\ntions that need not be known in advance (informa\ntion retrieval). While it is often assumed that certain\ndialog styles are more or less suited to novice users,\nit is the nature of the task that dictates appropriate\nness of dialog style rather than the level of expertise\nof the user. A spoken dialog system (SDS), which\nwould allow users to access information by voice, ei\nther over the phone lines or at a kiosk, could play a\nrole in overcoming current barriers of cost and liter\nacy faced by traditional UI devices in developing re\ngions. Speech-driven UIs are less expensive than\ndisplay-based UI solutions and more accessible than\ntext-based UI solutions. Most people in developing\nregions have never used a computer and generally\nfeel uncomfortable using it for the arst time for fear\nof breaking an expensive machine. Previous user\nstudies (Parikh et al., 2003; Medhi, Sagar, & Toyama,\n2006) in southern India found that voice feedback\nin the local language greatly helps with user interest\nand comfort.\nAudio output that enhances a graphical interface\nor powers a telephony system can be created from\nspeech synthesis or pre-recorded audio ales. Synthe\nsized speech may have poor pronunciation, but it re\nquires a lesser amount of memory and offers an\nunlimited vocabulary. Speech synthesis is readily\navailable for a handful of languages, using the open\nsource, Festival system (Black, Taylor & Caley, 1999),\nbut each new language voice requires months to\ndevelop (Dutoit et al., 1996). In our project, we re\nlied on prerecorded speech from a native speaker\nfor all audio output. The following sections describe\nsome of the factors that inouence the design of\nspeech based UI in developing regions.\nLiteracy is usually used to describe an individual's\ncompetency at the tasks of reading and writing, or\nher exposure to formal schooling. It is important to\nnote that deanitions of literacy only apply to people\nwho live within a literate society. In traditional, oral\nsocieties, men and women of considerable learning,\nwisdom, and understanding, such as priests and tra\nditional healers, transmit cultural and societal history\nthrough oral methods, though these individuals\nwould be considered non-literate by most deanitions\nof literacy.\nVolume 4, Number 1, Fall 2007\n\nSPEECH INTERFACES FOR EQUITABLE ACCESS TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\nIn oral communities, information is primarily dis\nseminated by word of mouth. Literacy increases ac\ncess to information over wider distances in space\nand time. Of the estimated 880 million adults who\nare not literate, two-thirds are women and two-\nthirds live in India (Lievesley & Motivans, 2000),\nwhere health, nutrition, and earning potential posi\ntively correlate with literacy (Psacharopoulus, 1994;\nCensus of Tamil Nadu, 2001; Borooah, 2004). In ru\nral Tamil Nadu, illiteracy rates can be as high as\n50% for men and 80% for women (Census of In\ndia, 2001).\nUnschooled adults primarily rely on empirical, sit\nuational reasoning rather than abstract, categorical\nreasoning (Scribner, 1977). Design features consid\nered standard or intuitive in traditional user interface\nliterature, such as hierarchical browsing, and icons\nthat represent concepts are found to present a chal\nlenge to individuals with no formal schooling. Re\nsearchers agree on the following requirements for\nuser interface designs that accommodate un\nschooled individuals (Deo, et al. 2004; Parikh,\nKaushik, & Chavan, 2003; Medhi, Sagar, & Toyama,\n2006; Plauche & Prabaker, 2006):\n- Ease of learning, ease of remembrance\n- No textual requirements\n- Graphics (and possibly speech in local lan\nguage)\n- Support for internationalization\n- Accommodates localization\n- Simple, easy to use, tolerant of errors\n- Accurate content\n- Robust in (potentially distracting) public spaces\nFor each new language and culture, the following UI\ndesign elements are subject to change: fonts, color,\ncurrency, abbreviations, dates, register, icons, con\ncepts of time and space, value systems, behavioral\nsystems. Traditional approaches to accessing models\nof culture include questionnaires, storyboards, and\nwalkthroughs with a large sample of potential users\nat each stage of UI development (Schneiderman,\n1992; Delgado & Araki, 2005). These user study\ntechniques, however, present difaculties for un\nschooled, marginalized populations because of their\ndaily requirements and ambient infrastructure\n(Huenerfauth, 2002; Brewer et al., 2006; Plauche et\nal., 2006). This might account for the relatively few\npublications reporting user studies in developing re\ngions, despite the growing interest in researchers\nand developers of technology for rural populations.\nWe predict that successful UI design for predomi\nnantly oral communities will build on existing means\nof information transfer and existing linguistic and\ncultural expertise by enabling community authorship\nof content.\nWe developed OpenSesame, an SDS template for\ncreating multi-modal spoken dialog systems for de\nveloping regions. We worked collaboratively with\nagricultural and community experts of MSSRF staff\nto port one unit (Banana Crop) of the text-based\nValam website to the interactive OpenSesame appli\ncation. User studies for the Banana Crop SDS were\nconducted using live speech recognition in Dindigul\ndistrict, Tamil Nadu. The audio input recorded during\nuser interactions with OpenSesame SDS served to\nsimulate integrated data collection and ASR adapta\ntion techniques, as discussed in the following sec\ntions.\nThe OpenSesame SDS runs on a multimodal proto\ntype that allows both speech and touch input. The\noutput includes graphics, a small amount of text,\nand prerecorded audio ales. We constructed a\nmodiaable oex button system by soldering the \"re\nset\" buttons from used computers to the function\nkeys of a dedicated keyboard (Figure 12). The low-\nFigure 12.

Construction of the prototype is\ntransparent, cheap, and easy to construct from lo\ncally available materials.\nResearchers and MSSRF staff collaborated to create\nan interactive version of one unit (Banana Crop) of\nthe Valam website, using the OpenSesame SDS tem\nplate. Banana Crop SDS adhered to the design\nguidelines for UIs previously described and was com\npleted in less than 3 weeks. Our rapid, collaborative\nprocess involved identifying appropriate content,\nverifying the accuracy of the text version, gathering\ndigital pictures, recording the speech output, and\nsynchronizing all elements. MSSRF staff used their\nexpertise and connections with local agricultural ex\nperts, universities, farmers, and merchants to locate\nrelevant sites and stage demonstrations of recom-\nVolume 4, Number 1, Fall 2007\nPLAUCHE, NALLASAMY\nmended techniques. Their exper\ntise in recommended agricultural\npractices informed the portrayal\nof content. For example, farmers\nidentify banana varieties primarily\nby their fruit, not by the tree.\nPhotos were prepared accord\ningly. The researchers provided\ndesign and scheduling recom\nmendations based on the limita\ntions and strengths of the\ntechnology. Synchronizing the im\nages and the audio output was\nthe most time consuming part of\ndevelopment, which led us to\nlater develop a graphical user in\nterface (GUI) editor for easy\nmodiacation of OpenSesame ap\nplications.\nTwenty-eight acoustically dis\nsimilar and locally appropriate vo\ncabulary words were selected to\ncorrespond to the Valam website\nsubheadings (Soil Preparation, Va\nrieties, etc.). The menu system\nwas only three levels deep and\npresented no more than eight op\ntions at time. The system was\nhighly redundant, explicitly listing options at every\nscreen and disseminating information in the form of\nan audio slide show in Tamil when no input was\nprovided. The result is an interactive dialog system\nthat educates the user through digital photographs\nand narrative in Tamil on the recommended prac\ntices for growing, harvesting, and propagating a ba\nnana crop according to local conditions and needs\n(Figure 13).\nThe recognizer for the SDS must recognize multiple\nspeakers and be robust to noisy conditions under\nconditions of limited linguistic data. The recognizer\nthat powers Banana Crop SDS was trained on the\ntranscribed Tamil speech recordings described in the\nprevious section (Field Study 1). The speech\nrecognizer is built using the hidden Markov model\ntoolkit (HTK) (Young, 1996). A pronunciation dictio\nnary was prepared by listing each vocabulary word\nalong with its phonemic representation. Training\nmodels at the sub word level (e.g., phones and\n\nSPEECH INTERFACES FOR EQUITABLE ACCESS TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\nFigure 14. Categories of input from all six sessions. The\npercentages shown do not total 100, as they refer to\nthe recognition results within each category, not the\nportion of all data the category represents. One Vocab\nword is referred to as the SDS Tamil 2006 database in\nlater sections.\ntriphones) allow a recognizer to accommodate new\nwords and phonetic contextual variations.\nA test database was prepared by recording ave\nMSSRF staff members saying each vocabulary word\nthree times each to evaluate the ASR. When we\ntrained our recognizer on monophone models, rec\nognition on the test database yielded 73% accuracy.\nTriphone models (single Gaussian) performed at\n97% accuracy. For subsequent user studies, our\nrecognizer used triphone models and state-based\nparameter tying for robust estimation.\nThe Banana Crop SDS was evaluated by rural villag\ners in three different conditions across six different\nsites (Table 3). Approximately 50 people (roughly\nequal women and men) actively navigated the sys\ntem using either touch or speech input. An esti\nmated additional 200 people were onlookers who\noffered feedback based on that role. The partici\npant's audio commands to the system were re\ncorded during use. Sessions with each person were\ngenerally short, involved very little training, and in\nvited informal feedback. In particular, people were\nasked to comment on the content, how easy the\ntouch or voice input was to learn, and any prefer\nences between the two modalities. We did not at\ntempt a formal user study of the SDS. Our goal was\nto use the SDS to record speech during user interac\ntions in order to design ASR adaptation techniques\nthat would optimize performance by gradually inte\ngrating user speech into existing models.\nThe overall categories of input recorded across all\nsessions are shown in Figure 14. The majority of in\nput was hand-labeled as \"N/A,\" or \"Not Applica\nble.\" This category includes sound ales which are\neither empty, contain no speech, or contain irrele\nvant background speech. The recognizer correctly\nidentiaed 23% of these tokens as \"silence.\" Ap\nproximately 15% of all input were utterances\ndirected at the application but not included in\nthe recognizer's restricted vocabulary (out-of\nvocabulary). The recognizer did not include a model\nfor out-of-vocabulary input, so recognition perfor\nmance on this set was 0%. Input that contained a\nvocabulary word, either alone (one vocab word) or\nwith other input (vocab word plus), represented less\nthan a third of all input data, and was recognized at\nrates of 58% and 34%, respectively.\nRecognition performance on isolated vocabulary\nwords was much worse for speech recorded during\nSDS interactions (58% accuracy) than for the speech\nrecorded from MSSRF staff as they read words aloud\nin a quiet oface (97% accuracy). Although ASR is\nknown to degrade in noisy environments, the\nspeech from MSSRF staff did not vary signiacantly\nfrom SDS sessions in signal to noise ratio, which was\noverall remarkably good (~20dB). The degradation is\nmore likely due to the dissimilarity in speaking style\nbetween reading aloud and issuing commands to a\nmachine.\nFurther investigation into recognition perfor\nmance by site was conducted only on input com\nprised of a vocabulary word either alone (one vocab\nword) or with other speech (vocab word plus) (Fig\nure 15). Performance does appear to be subject to\nsocial and environmental factors, as the highest rate\nof performance is found in the Sempatti session, a\ncontrolled user study with all literate subjects. The\nlowest performance occurred in S. Kanur, a farmer\nfocus group in a much more distracting setting: a\nschoolroom with approximately 100 people and 2\nonlookers for every participant.\nAlthough overall recognition was poor, partici\npants reported that the interface is easy to use. The\nmost educated participants often commented that\nthe system would be \"good for people who cannot\nread.\" We noted that the least educated partici-\nInformation Technologies and International Development\n\nPLAUCHE, NALLASAMY\nfocus groups).

The farmer focus groups\nenabled us to observe the advan\ntages of audio enabled software\nfor multiple user settings, which\nwere not apparent in our con\ntrolled user study conditions.\nSo far, we have presented design\nand technology considerations for\nspeech interfaces that meet crite\nria for equitable access, in partic\nular for users in developing\nregions. Our belief is that speech\ninterface solutions, especially\nthose that can be easily modiaed\nby local experts, can allow oral\npopulations access to digital, local\nresources. The technology that\npowers such a speech interface\nmust also be easily customizable\nto new languages and dialects.\nHere, we introduce ASR adapta\ntion, a technique for automati\npants preferred to listen to the system for several\nminutes before speaking to it. When prompted ex\nplicitly, some subjects reported preferring the touch\nscreen as a means of input, others preferred speech.\nMany corrections and suggestions were offered for\nBanana Crop SDS, especially the addition of more\ncrops to the system.\nThe three recording conditions (Table 3) were\nadopted out of oexibility to the available infrastruc\nture, which ranged from a dedicated room in a vil\nlage center (controlled user study) to a mat outside\na home (village outreach). We tried to balance con\ntrolled user studies with existing methods of com\nmunity information oow used by MSSRF (farmer\ncally or semiautomatically optimizing a recognizer by\ngradually integrating new, untranscribed data into\nthe models for speech. Small vocabulary speech\nrecognizers that are initialized with available data\nthen tuned to user speech input with adaptation\ntechniques can scale to new domains and new dia\nlects more quickly and more affordably than large\nvocabulary, continuous speech systems.\nOnly a handful of speech technology efforts\n(Nayeemulla Khan & Yegnarayana, 2001; Saraswathi\n& Geetha 2004; Udhyakumar, Swaminathan, &\nRomakrishnan, 2004) have been dedicated to Tamil,\nwhich is spoken by more than 60 million people in\nVolume 4, Number 1, Fall 2007\n\nSPEECH INTERFACES FOR EQUITABLE ACCESS TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY\nFigure 15. Recognition performance by site.\nTamil Nadu, Sri Lanka, and throughout the world\n(Comrie 1987). When annotated corpora for a given\nlanguage are limited or unavailable, as is the case\nfor most languages spoken in developing regions, a\nrecognizer trained on transcribed data from one or\nmore (source) languages, can be used to recognize\nspeech in the new (target) language. This technique,\ncalled cross-language transfer, yields the best results\nwhen the source and target languages are linguisti\ncally similar and when the recognizer is trained on\nmultiple languages.\nLanguage adaptation is a technique in which the\nrecognizer is trained on a large source language cor\npus and then the acoustic models are adapted to a\nvery limited amount of target language data. Perfor\nmance correlates to the amount of data available in\nthe target language and the number of different\nspeakers used for training. During bootstrapping,\nacoustic models are initialized from a small amount\nof transcribed source data. The speech recognition\nsystem is then iteratively rebuilt, using increasing\namounts of training data and adaptation (Schultz &\nTable 4. Language Adaptation Techniques and\nData Conditions1\nCross-language Transfer\nNo data\nLanguage Adaptation\nVery limited data\nBootstrapping\nLarge amounts of data\n1See Waibel et al., 2000.\nWaibel, 1998; Kumar & Wei,\n2003; Udhyakumar et al., 2004).\nBased on the speech we collected\ni\nl\nn the aeld with Banana Crop\nSDS, we ran a series of recognizer\nexperiments to determine how to\noptimize the small vocabulary\nrecognizer to the speech of a par\nticular community given no or\nimited Tamil training data. We\nsimulated ASR performance un\nder conditions of no available\ntraining data (cross-language\ntransfer) and very limited training\ndata (language adaptation) using\nthe following databases: SDS\nTamil 2006, Tamil 2006, Tamil 2005, and English\nTIMIT (Table 5).\nIn the aeld, the recognizer trained only on Tamil\n2005 data recognized commands for Banana Crop\nSDS with 58.1% accuracy. We noted a substantial\nimprovement (68.7%) with the addition of cepstral\nmean subtraction, an increase in model size from\nsingle Gaussian to 16 Gaussians, and the collapse of\ncertain contrastive phonetic categories (long vs.\nshort vowels) in the pronunciation dictionary (Figure\n16). Simple noise robustness methods such as\ncepstral mean subtraction factor out environmental\nnoise and generalize across tasks and speakers.\nWhen an annotated corpus for a given language\nis unavailable, the options are to build one by col\nlecting and transcribing speech, as we did in 2005,\nor to train a recognizer on an available corpus in an\nother language. We arst mapped the Tamil pho\nnemes to English phonemes as closely as possible.\nThen, training and decoding were performed using\nHTK (Young, 1997). The acoustic models are trained\narst with a default oat initialization. Then triphone\nmodels are developed based on monophone HMMs\nand the recognizer decodes in a single pass using a\nsimple, anite state grammar. Test results for the\nrecognizer on speech input from the aeld (SDS Tamil\n2006) show that the accuracy was signiacantly\nbetter when trained on a small amount of same lan\nguage data than when trained on a greater amount\nof mismatched data. A Tamil SDS powered by a\nrecognizer trained on English speech would only\npredict the correct word 30% of the time.\nInformation Technologies and International Development\n\nPLAUCHE, NALLASAMY\nTable 5.

The Tamil 2006 da\ntabase is an available, yet very limited, language cor\npus that was rapidly collected and annotated\n(approximately 1 hour of nonexpert time). Adapta\ntion to Tamil 2006 improves performance for both\nthe recognizer trained on English and the recognizer\ntrained on Tamil. It is interesting that the results are\ncomparable (82.2% and 80.4%, respectively). There\nis very little to be gained by collecting and annotat\ning a corpus like Tamil 2005, which took an esti\nmated 100 hours of expert time, when adapting an\nEnglish-trained system to a very small, easily pre\npared data set like Tamil 2006 yields similar results.\nThis technique is supervised, as the adaptation data\nis manually transcribed before adaptation.\nASR adaptation can overcome the high costs of\nrecording and annotating a large training corpus.\nAdaptation can also be unsupervised when a\nrecognizer is automatically improved by gradually in\ntegrating new, untranscribed speech into intialized\nacoustic models (Kemp & Waibel, 1999; Lakshmi &\nMurthy, 2006). A conadence measure is used to\nrank the data; those with the highest scores are se\nlected for integration. Similar adaptation efforts\nhave sought to include, yet minimize, human partici\npation for training acoustic models. In supervised\nadaptation, the utterances with the lowest con\nadence scores are deemed to be the most informa-\nVolume 4, Number 1, Fall 2007\nAgricultural words spoken by villagers retrieving\ninformation from Banana Crop SDS indoors and\nout in Dindigul district\nSame agricultural words read out loud by\nMSSRF staff in a fairly quiet office in Dindigul\ndistrict\nDigits and verbs read or guessed out loud by\nspeakers of all literacy levels indoors and out in\nthree districts\nPhonetically balanced sentences read out loud\nin a quiet laboratory setting\nFigure 16.

They are automatically selected for hand tran\nscription and integration into the training data, re\nsulting in a reduction of the amount of labeled data\nneeded by as much as 75% (Lamel, Gauvain, &\nAdda, 2000; Riccardi & Hakkani-Tur, 2003). Further\nexploration of (semi-) automatic adaptation tech\nniques will surely result in robust, rapid development\nASR for limited-resource environments.\nThis article reviews literature on the language, ac\ncess, and information requirements likely to be\nfound in primarily oral, limited-resource environ\nments.

Integrated data collection and language adap\ntation are found to be useful techniques for collect\ning linguistic resources according to both user and\nsystem needs.\nIn future studies, we plan to determine the small\nest amount of adaptation data required to reach ad\nequate levels of ASR accuracy. We would also like to\nexplore how speech/no speech detectors and out-of\nvocabulary models could play a role in a robust,\nadaptive SDS/ASR system. Recall that 75% of SDS\ninput consisted of unusable data. We envision an\nSDS that is initialized with a large amount of avail\nable data perhaps from a different language, then\nas it is used in a village or community, participants'\nspeech is recorded, prealtered, and gradually inte\ngrated (automatically or semiautomatically) to adapt\nto the dialect and speaking style. We hope to see\nfurther work in simple, affordable designs for\nspeech synthesis and UI, especially for text-free\nbrowsing and searching across libraries of audio and\ndigital media. ■\nThe authors thank their volunteers, families, hosts\nand partner organizations in Tamil Nadu, as well as\ncolleagues and reviewers who contributed their en\ncouragement and insights.

Ltd.\nNoida, India\nKentaro Toyama\nMicrosoft Research India\nBangalore, India\nText-Free User Interfaces for\nIlliterate and Semiliterate Users\nWe describe work toward the goal of a user interface (UI) designed such that\neven novice, illiterate users require absolutely no intervention from anyone at\nall to use. Our text-free UI is based on many hours of ethnographic design\nconducted in collaboration with a community of illiterate domestic laborers in\nthree Bangalore slums. An ethnographic design process was used to under\nstand what kind of application subjects would be interested in, how they re\nspond to computing technology, and how they react to speciac UI elements.\nWe built two applications using these principles, one for job search for domes\ntic laborers and another for a generic map that could be used for navigating a\ncity. The resulting designs are based on key lessons that we gained through\nthe design process. This article describes the design process, the design princi\nples, which evolved out of the process, the anal application designs, and re\nsults from initial user testing. Our results conarm previous work that empha\nsizes the need for semiabstracted graphics and voice feedback, but we\nadditionally and that some aspects of design for illiterate users that have been\npreviously overlooked (such as a consistent help feature). Results also show\nthat the text-free designs are strongly preferred over standard text-based in\nterfaces by the communities which we address and that they are potentially\nable to bring even complex computer functions within the reach of users who\nare unable to read.\nMost computer applications pose an accessibility barrier to those who are\nunable to read ouently. The heavy use of text on everything from menus\nto document content means that those who are illiterate or semiliterate\nare not able to access functions and services implemented on most com\nputer software.\nIt does not have to be this way. In particular, while there might be lim\nits to what static books can convey without text, computers are the ulti\nmate multimedia device. Through the use of graphics, animation, and\naudio, they have the potential to be wholly intelligible to a person who\ncannot read (Huenerfauth, 2002).\nThe basic features of what we call a text-free user interface (UI) are\nsimple to understand: liberal use of graphics and photographs for visual\ninformation, and voice for providing information normally provided via\ntext. However, research to date on UIs for illiterate users remains scant,\nand existing work presents broad design guidelines that do not address all\nof the issues.\nThe work presented in this article was motivated by a single goal: to\nprovide useful applications to communities of illiterate users, with a UI\ndesigned such that even novice, illiterate users required absolutely no in\n(c) The MIT Press 2008.

In particular,\nwe felt that if the UI were designed well, users\nwould not require formal literacy, computer skills, or\nany external assistance in order to operate the\napplication.\nWe certainly have not achieved this ambitious\ngoal, but in the process of aiming for it, we have\nuncovered some of the subtler issues that require\nconsideration when designing any text-free UI. We\nare also encouraged that the goal is not that far out\nof reach.\nThis article presents two applications that were\ndesigned using ethnographic or contextual design\ntechniques to ferret out the requirements for a text-\nfree UI. In the arst, an employment-search applica\ntion, the intent is to provide job information to a\ngroup of domestic laborers. In the second, we ex\nplore a text-free UI for maps that should allow illiter\nate users to answer questions having a geographic\ndimension.\nOur approach is one of contextual or ethno\ngraphic design (Crabtree & Rodden, 2002; Wasson,\n2002) in which intense interaction with a target\ncommunity is sought to gain a thorough under\nstanding of their real needs, real traits, and real re\nsponses to the interfaces we designed. Ultimately,\nwe spent a total of more than 180 hours working\nwith women in Bangalore slums to get feedback on\nour UI.\nSection 2 of this article describes our target com\nmunity and Section 3 gives an overview of the\nethnographic design process. Section 4 describes a\nset of core design principles along with examples of\nmany of the design details that we came upon dur\ning the iterative design process. Section 5 describes\nthe anal prototypes to which\nthese principles were applied.\nThese prototypes were then\ntested with subjects who were\ndrawn from the same community\nbut had not been exposed to the\napplications during the design\nprocess.\nWe based our project in three ur\nban slum communities in Banga\nlore, India. To gain access into\nthese communities we worked\nwith a nongovernmental organization called Stree\nJagruti Samiti, which has had an established pres\nence in these three slums for 15 years. Because\nStree Jagruti Samiti works primarily with the women\nin the slums, we also focused on the needs of the\nwomen for one of our projects (Figure 1).\nMost of the women in the slums are household\nworkers, either illiterate or semiliterate (highest edu\ncation attained being schooling up to the sixth\ngrade). The male members of the house are usually\ndaily wage laborers like plumbers, carpenters, con\nstruction workers, mechanics, bar benders, and fruit\nand vegetable vendors. Their primary language of\ncommunication is Kannada, which is also their na\ntive language. Apart from this a few people also\nspoke Hindi and Tamil. The average household in\ncome was INR 800-INR 3,000 (approximately USD\n18-USD 67) per month. A few of them also had\ntelevision sets, music players, and liquiaed petro\nleum gas burners. Some of them have seen comput\ners in the houses of their employers, but were\nprohibited from touching the computer (even for\nthe purposes of cleaning!). None of them had\nprevious experience using a computer. During the\ntime that we interacted with this community, we\ninteracted with no fewer than 80 women and men,\nwho ultimately saw the designs at some stage of\ntheir development.\nIn designing the UI, we drew from guidelines of\nethnographic design, in which techniques of eth\nnography were used to gain a deep understanding\nof the subjects, within the context of their speciac\nInformation Technologies and International Development\n\nMEDHI, SAGAR, TOYAMA\ngoals (Cooper & Reimann, 2003). We held inter\nviews and conducted subject trials with our target\ncommunities. We repeatedly went back to them\nto evaluate our designs and incorporated the neces\nsary changes in the next prototype we designed. Be\ning accepted and trusted by the community, making\nthe subjects feel comfortable to talk and extracting\nrelevant information from them (Parikh, Ghosh, &\nChavan, 2003b), helping them overcome fear and\nreluctance while using technology (Chand, 2002)\nwere a few of the challenges we faced during the\nprocess of design.\nWe had to take various actions to accommodate\nsubjects and make them feel at ease. We spent con\nsiderable time in the community, attending weekend\nmeetings to understand the context, culture, and\npractices (Parikh, Ghosh, & Chavan, 2003b). We vis\nited the communities on an average of two to three\ntimes a week, for 3-4 hours each session, for sev\neral months.\nWe used this approach to determine the applica\ntion domain in which to test our user interfaces. Our\nsubjects--mostly domestic laborers--and job infor\nmation through word of mouth or through agents\nwithin the slum that informally connected employers\nwith employees. Most of the women often contin\nued working at the same place for low wages be\ncause they were not aware of better opportunities\nelsewhere. We, therefore, decided arst to mock-up\na job-search application. Our focus group-style dis\ncussions of 40-50 women showed that the women\nwere accustomed to asking the following informa\ntion about a job: speciac tasks requested by the em\nployer, work schedule, break-up of wages by task,\naddress of the employer, number of rooms in the\nresidence, number of people residing, and location\nwithin the city.\nTo ensure that the design principles were not ap\nplication speciac, we also implemented a map appli\ncation that was meant to provide geographic\ninformation. Maps were not common artifacts for\nthe women we worked with, even though geogra\nphy was a critical factor in the daily decisions they\nmade; as a result, we felt it was a good testbed for\ntext-free UI.\nWe arrived at a set of design principles as guidelines\nfor text-free UIs as a result of the lessons learned\nfrom extensive aeld studies we conducted. We shall\nexplain these with examples elucidating each princi\nple in the following section:\nClearly, less text makes sense for subjects who can\nnot read. However, as we discovered that subjects\ncould easily recognize numerals (\"0\", \"1\", \"2\",\n\"3\", \"4,\" . . .), these numerals can remain in the UI\n(at least for certain target users). This is consistent\nwith advice in some earlier work (Parikh, 2002;\nParikh, Ghosh, & Chavan, 2003a, 2003b).\nWe knew that for both applications the information\nhad to be in graphical form, since our target users\nwere not generally literate (Huenerfauth, 2002;\nParikh, Ghosh, & Chavan, 2003a, 2003b). While this\nis an obvious feature, the exact nature of the graph\nics can make a huge difference, and, below, we out\nline some of the more subtle andings from the eth\nnographic design process.\nFrequent iterations with the target community\nare necessary to ensure that graphical elements are\ninterpreted the way they are intended. We observed\nthat subjects recognized semiabstract cartoons and\nmore photorealistic graphics much better than com\nplex abstract graphics. As users delve deeper into an\nobject to get more information, the representation\ncan become more photorealistic to provide more\nspeciac information.\nIn general, subjects were able to identify both\nphotographs and pure cartoons, but there was a\ngeneral preference for semiabstract cartoons. These\ncartoons were sketched by us and tested extensively\nin the aeld.\nToo much abstraction could cause some difaculty.\nFor example, in the map application, animated ar\nrows for depicting one- or two-way trafac were not\nreadily understood. When the arrows were replaced\nwith small icons of cars, subjects immediately under\nstood the meaning (Foltz & Davis, 2001). There was\nalso a tendency to take some abstracted elements\nliterally. Color of the graphical elements, for exam\nple, played a role in interpretation of map entities.\nFor example initially we tried to depict roads in 80%\nblack that on mouse hover become yellow. The idea\nwas to highlight and separate the road as an indi\nvidual entity. We received the feedback from the us\ners that roads can never be yellow and they are\nVolume 4, Number 1, Fall 2007\n\nTEXT-FREE USER INTERFACES FOR ILLITERATE AND SEMILITERATE USERS\nFigure 4. Ambiguity in iconic representation due to\ncultural biases: Our initial design indicating start and\nend times for a job places the start time at left (left).\nFigure 2. Unabstracted icons with action cues.\nThis is misinterpreted in Muslim culture. Adding an ar\nrow avoids this problem (right).\nFigure 3. Indicators of which tasks were required in\nwhich rooms. The matrix structure (top) was not\nreadily understood.\nalways black. Based on this feedback, we changed\nthe color of the road to 100% black and on mouse\nhover 80% black.\nIn some cases, an abstract icon worked for a\ngeneral instance (e.g., hospital) but was not\nsufacient for indicating a speciac instance (e.g.,\nJayanagar Hospital). To resolve this problem, we\nused actual photos of speciac landmarks to appear\non mouse hover.\nThe devil is in the details. For example, actions may\nrequire a visual representation, or they would be\ntaken as static representations of location or object\n(Huenerfauth, 2002).\nWe found that they were better able to identify\nactivities as actions when the cartoon included stan\ndard visual cues for indicating motion--water run\nning in a faucet, steam pufang out from a kettle,\nand so forth (Figure 2). Without these action ele\nments, subjects felt the drawings represented ob-\nFigure 5. Designs for the \"residence\" icon. Our initial\ndesign (left) was perceived as a hut; the anal design\n(right) is more in line with what our subjects inter\npreted as an urban residence.\njects or locations (e.g., kitchen), rather than the as\nsociated action (e.g., cooking).\nWe had used a matrix of checks and crosses to\nshow what activities needed to take place in which\nrooms (Figure 3). These were not readily understood\nby our subjects, echoing results from other work\nthat suggest graphical representations must be kept\nsimple (Parikh, Ghosh, & Chavan, 2003b). We re\nplaced them with explicit associations between\nroom and task without the matrix structure. Some\ntimes differences in religion or culture caused differ\nent interpretations of graphical elements. For\nexample, probably because Urdu is written from\nright to left, Muslim culture views time as oowing\nfrom right to left by default. Where we display work\nschedules, this required an explicit arrow between\nour start and end clocks faces, so that there was no\nmisunderstanding (Figure 4).\nSome of our initial icons were not interpreted the\nway we expected (Huenerfauth, 2002; Parikh,\nGhosh, & Chavan, 2003b). For example, our initial\ngraphic for a residence is shown in Figure 5 (left),\nwhat we thought was a universal symbol for a\nhouse. Our subjects, however, perceived it as a vil\nlage hut and were confused, because they expected\nthat prospective employers would live in a tall apart\nment complex; with their feedback, we redesigned\nthis logo as shown in Figure 5 (right).\nInformation Technologies and International Development\n\nMEDHI, SAGAR, TOYAMA\nFigure 6. Map application with heavy use of land\nmarks.\nThe clear value of voice feedback is noted in previ\nous work (Huenerfauth, 2002; Parikh, 2002; Parikh,\nGhosh, & Chavan, 2003a, 2003b). It is important,\nhowever, that this guideline is zealously applied.\nThe use of help instructions allows an application to\nbe more autonomously used, even for novice users.\nOptionally, an on-screen character could be placed\nso that users can put a visual agure to voice play\nback.\nAs expected from novice users, the subjects did not\nhave ouent control of the mouse and stylus and\nhesitated to click the mouse or press the stylus, as\nalso mentioned in some previous work (Chand,\n2002). At one point, we tried a click-free interface\nin which actions associated with clicking occurred\nafter a 3-second mouse hover.\nHowever, subjects were as confused by this as by\nexperienced PC users (who typically and such behav\nior annoying). We therefore ultimately removed the\nclick-free feature and kept click-free actions to be\nthose which were either (a) associated with addi\ntional information (e.g., photo display or voice on\nmousing over an icon) or (b) immediately associated\nwith moving the mouse onto an actionable icon\n(e.g., panning the map using the borders of the ap-\nFigure 7. Design of the \"Introduction\" page of the\nanal prototype of the application.\nplication). In the latter case, we found it useful to\nreserve clicking for advanced versions of the same\naction (e.g., accelerated panning).\nThroughout all of our queries about physical loca\ntion, one abundant piece of feedback was that our\nsubjects relied primarily on landmarks--and not ab\nsolute (north-south-east-west) direction or ad\ndresses and street names--for navigation. Thus, in\nour employment-search application, we restricted\nour attention to an almost purely landmark based\ninterface; whereas in our map application, we ex\nplored additional map functions while keeping a\nlandmark-based presentation (Figure 6).\nWe put these design principles into use as thor\noughly as possible in designing our two applications.\nThe anal prototypes are as follows (voiced help in\nstructions for the employment application are in the\nappendix):\nIntroduction Page\nThe arst page consists of an icon that represents job\ninformation for employees.

On clicking this icon, one\narrives at the \"Location\" page (Figure 8).\nLocation Page\nThe user can retrieve information about how many\njobs are available in each area. On mousing over a\nlandmark, the placename is called out, and the rect\nangular icons animate into an enlarged image of the\nlandmark. A click on one of these rectangles on the\nmap allows the user to navigate to the \"Job Listing\"\npage (Figure 9).\nJob Listing Pages\nIn these pages, the jobs available in a neighborhood\nare listed along with the basic information about\neach job. In order to proceed to detailed job descrip\ntions, the user must click anywhere within a\nparticular row of information.\nJob Description Page\nThis page compiles all of the relevant details about a\nparticular job--address of the potential employer,\nwage break-ups, chores to be performed, number of\nrooms in the employer's house and the work timings\nwith voice descriptions on mouseover. On every\npage, there is a \"back\" button to return to the pre\nvious page (Figure 10).\nThe anal prototype for map application consisted of\none screen having all the major landmarks and\nroads. It allowed its users to pan, rotate, and zoom\nthe map from any point (Figure 11). The additional\nfeatures applied in this application are panning on\nmouse hover using a border of 16 pixels on all the\nfour sides, rotation of map, visual altering of land\nmarks, and virtual companion.\nWe performed preliminary subject testing with both\napplications to get a sense for the following ques\ntions, before proceeding with a large-scale study:\n1. Can illiterate or semiliterate users use tradi\ntional text-based UIs at all?\n2. Do the proposed design principles for text-free\nUIs allow illiterate users to use computers, and\nto what extent?\nInformation Technologies and International Development\n\nFigure 11. Design of the anal prototype of the map\napplication.\n3. Which of the design principles make the most\ndifference for a text-free UI?\nThe answer to the arst question would seem an ob\nvious \"no,\" and our results verify this, but to the\nbest of our knowledge this is the arst time that this\nquestion has been formally tested. The other two\nquestions are broader and the tests were intended\nto reveal the value of the proposed design princi\nples.\nIn traditional user studies, subjects are generally fa\nmiliar with computers and live in economic condi\ntions similar to their testers. Because of this, tests\ncan be conducted in usability labs with controlled\nenvironments, and little attention needs to be paid\nto the mental comfort of the subjects. In our case,\nhowever, our subjects were not habitual users of\nPCs (hence, our terminology below will refer to\nthem as \"subjects\" not \"users\"), and, more impor\ntant, they were drawn from communities that often\nfear testing of any kind and and air-conditioned\noface environments alien and possibly intimidating.\nThus, we needed to make a number of modiaca\ntions to ensure that subjects were as comfortable in\nthe environment and testing scenario as possible.\nFirst, in all cases, we performed the testing in a\nphysical setting that was routine for the participants.\nIn most instances, we visited subjects in their own\nhomes (in slum neighborhoods of Bangalore); in a\nfew cases, we conducted tests in the homes of their\nemployers. Second, for all of our participants, we\nVolume 4, Number 1, Fall 2007\nMEDHI, SAGAR, TOYAMA\nreached out through contacts whom they trusted,\nand who were in almost all cases present through\nthe duration of the study. Although this was less\nthan ideal for thorough randomized testing, we\ncould not and an easy way around the fact that\nmost subjects would not feel at all comfortable un\ndergoing technology tests with strangers. The criti\ncal aspect of the subjects--that they were illiterate\nor semiliterate--however, was preserved.\nThird, while most (though not all) user studies\ntend to focus on isolated tasks, we found this was\ninadequate, as subjects had a poor understanding\nof the capacity of the computer overall, and almost\nno sense for what kind of tasks could be accom\nplished. We used a methodology termed the \"Bolly\nwood Method\" (Shaffer, 2004), in which tasks are\nembedded in dramatized stories involving the\nsubject, which has been found to be better at moti\nvating subjects toward the desired tasks, even\nfor computer novices. Particularly in an Indian con\ntext, where subjects tend to be reserved about giv\ning feedback to people they perceive to be in\nauthority--as test administrators were perceived to\nbe--this was an invaluable tool for encouraging\nhonest feedback.\nWe tested both the employment-search and map\napplications with two interfaces: one that was text-\nbased and another that was text-free. The text-\nbased and text-free versions of both applications\nhad the same content, so that we could isolate the\ndifferences due to interface design.\nEmployment Search\nFor this application, we actually tested three\nconagurations, as follows:\n- Text-based version: A standard text-based web\ninterface, with routine structuring and indent\ning of data for ease of reading.\n- Text-free version with help instructions: the\ntext-free employment-search UI as described in\nthe \"Final Prototype\" section.\n- Text-free version without help instructions: the\ntext-free employment-search UI as described in\nthe \"Final Prototype\" section, but without the\nhelp feature.\nScript\nWe arst began with a (very) basic overview of com\nputers and introduced the application to the user.\n\nTEXT-FREE USER INTERFACES FOR ILLITERATE AND SEMILITERATE USERS\nOnce we were satisaed that they understood the ca\npability of the application, we then told them the\nfollowing story: A friend of theirs who lived in their\nneighborhood was in trouble and desperately look\ning for a job. Their objective was to and the best-\npaying job in a nearby neighborhood and to be able\nto report the address of the potential employer. (We\ninitially started by asking them to and a job for\nthemselves but switched to this scenario after one\nwoman in one of our earlier trials seemed agitated\nby the idea that she would need to and herself a\njob.) This was broken down into two subtasks for\ntesting purposes: (1) reach the point where they can\nidentify their own neighborhood and (2) respond\nwith the address of the highest-paying job in their\nneighborhood.\nMap\nIn this we compared our text-free digital map UI\nwith one commercially available text-based digital\nmap of Bangalore.\nScript\nWe took a commercially available text-based digital\n(MapCue Bangalore, 2001) and our text-free map of\nBangalore to the users for anal user testing. Unlike\nthe more open methodology used in the user stud\nies, here we deaned three tasks for each of the us\ners and embedded them into three stories. The goal\nwas to test both maps in lifelike situations that may\noccur and to compare the degree to which subjects\ncould complete the tasks. Each time, we presented\none of the maps to the users arst and asked them\nto accomplish the task on it. Once they completed\nthe task (or had given up), we then presented the\nother map and had them try the same task on that\nmap. Half of the subjects saw the text-based map\narst; the others, the text-free map.\nOur subjects were drawn from the same community\nas described in the \"Target Community\" Section.\nThe subjects were illiterate and semiliterate (could\nwrite their names, read isolated words and do some\nbasic addition) adults living in slums who had no\nprevious exposure to computers. All have used pay\nphones and TVs. We chose a range of such partici\npants varying in age, environment in which they\nlived and worked at present, and their familiarity\nand comfort with technology. The taxonomy with an\nexample from our test participant of each of the\ncategories is as follows:\n1. Has never seen a computer: Newly migrated\ninto the city from the village; has never seen a\ncomputer before.\n2. Has only seen a computer rarely, but never\none being used: Typical of part-time domestic\nhelper who has seen a seen a computer at an\nemployer's house but has never touched a\ncomputer, even to clean one.\n3) Regularly sees people using a computer: Full-\ntime house-keeping staff member at an oface\nwith PCs; has never used PCs; possibly came\ninto contact while cleaning.\nFor the employment-search application, we\ntested four single participants and two collaborative\ngroups of ave women each. All subject sets were\ntested on all three versions of the application (text\nbased, text-free with help, and text-free without\nhelp), in randomized order. For the map application,\nthree individuals were tested on both the text-based\nand text-free UI.\nThese numbers are admittedly small, and the\nquantitative results (presented in Appendix) do not\nachieve statistical signiacance. However, over the\ncourse of our design iterations, we interacted with\nmore than 80 women and men of varying ages (the\nmajority were adults, but some of the tests included\nchildren who were only 13 years old, but had adult\nwork responsibilities) for a total of more than 180\nhours spent with subjects, and, although most of\nthis time was not spent in formal subject testing,\nthese interactions provided a signiacant amount of\ninformal data, which was consistent with what we\nfound in our formal tests--if not quantitatively, at\nleast qualitatively.\nThe two collaborative subject tests had two\ngroups of ave participants (with one person control\nling the stylus) interact with the employment search\napplication. We noted signiacant differences in indi\nvidual and group tests which are discussed in the\nqualitative section of the results below.\nResults are given in Tables 1 and 2. Our tests an\nswered the arst of our questions decisively. Overall,\nparticipants were totally unable to make any sense\nof the text-based user interfaces for either applica-\nInformation Technologies and International Development\n\nMEDHI, SAGAR, TOYAMA\nTable 1.

Many of these were rolled\nback into later redesigns. The others we offer here\nas possible hypotheses for future veriacation or for\napplication to future work with text-free UIs.\nImmediate Comprehension of Voice Feedback\nWith almost no exception, we found the same reac\ntion to those who were exposed for the arst time to\nvoice feedback in their own language: Most were\nthrilled to hear a computer speak in their native lan\nguage and went as far as to call others in the vicin\nity to hear for themselves. In fact, voice feedback\nappeared to make the applications fun for subjects,\nwho seemed more engaged and eager to explore\nthe application.\nDuring our trials, there were a few cases when\nsubjects had heard from previous subjects that there\nwere both text-based and text-free versions of each\napplication. If they were given the text-based UI\narst, they would frequently ask for the text-free ver\nsion, on which they felt they could perform better.\nCollaborative Use\nAt one point when we were conducting subject\nstudies, a group of women began playing with the\napplication between our formal test sessions. As\nthey seemed more animated, we allowed them to\ncontinue for some time. In our individual tests, sub\njects appeared nervous and uncomfortable, probably\nbecause they were being videotaped and scrutinized\nin isolation in front of researchers. The group, on\nthe other hand, seemed more conadent, suggesting\nideas to one another, discussing the purpose of the\napplication, advising each other, and interacting\nmore boldly with the computer. Their faces beamed\nand their voices were louder compared with single-\nsubject tests. This prompted us to do the collabora\ntive studies cited above, but we feel there is the po\ntential for future design taking into account a\ncollaborative user model, as well.\nThe Value of Help\nIn addition to the fact that the help feature short\nened the time that tasks were completed in the em\nployment search application, they were also found\nto be a constant source of reassurance to users.\nThere were occasions when before performing a\nInformation Technologies and International Development\n\ntask on a particular page they referred to help three\nor four times. As with voice feedback, the help fea\nture made them eager to explore the text-free UI,\nwhereas without help the response was more sub\ndued; participants did not seem as interested in ex\nploring. In one of the sessions, we observed that\nsubjects went to the help icon themselves without\nany prompting and performed the actions exactly as\ntold by the help. The same pattern continued for\nforthcoming screens, and before taking any further\naction they referred to help.\nThis was brought out in our map application,\nwhich, although it provided functional help for each\nicon, offered no overall help feature. Throughout\nthe study, we found that we needed to prompt and\nencourage subjects to try out things on screen. It is\npossible that a few encouraging voice instructions\ntelling users how to operate the tool would be\nhelpful.\nNavigation Metaphor\nIn our employment-search application, we felt that\nsubjects were quicker to understand hypertext navi\ngation when they were told to think of the pages as\npages in a book. Although no quantitative studies\nwere performed, the most recent version of the help\nrecordings that made this analogy seemed to help\nmore than earlier versions that did not.\nNo Faith in Technology\nFor at least two of our subjects, it took a signiacant\neffort to explain to them that a computer could pro\nvide them with the information they were asked to\nand in their scenarios. One test subject, in particular,\nwas ultimately not convinced about a computer's\nability to deliver job-related information and was ap\nathetic to the point that she refused to continue\nwith the study.\nSubject Involvement Among Test Subjects\nOne thing we found repeatedly among our more\ncomfortable subjects was that they were eager to\ngive us advice about design and potential features\n(Parikh, Ghosh, & Chavan, 2003a, 2003b).\nThe existing body of research that investigates user\ninterfaces for illiterate users work is recent and few\nresearch groups have looked at designing for this\npopulation. Early researchers in this area place em-\nVolume 4, Number 1, Fall 2007\nMEDHI, SAGAR, TOYAMA\nphasis on the need for contextual design methods\nto explore this problem, as illiterate users are very\ndifferent from the target user imagined by most UI\ndesigners (Cooper & Reimann, 2003). We follow this\nlead, and have spent literally hundreds of hours in\nthe aeld, working with illiterate women. Most pre\nvious work with illiterate users suggests the use of\ngraphical information. In particular, researchers im\nmediately intuited the value of imagery in place of\ntext, and extensive use of graphics is advocated by\nmost of this work (Griesdale, Graves, & Grunsteidl,\n1997; Huenerfauth 2002; Parikh, Ghosh, & Chavan,\n2003a, 2003b; Medhi & Kuriyan, 2007; Medhi, Pitti,\n& Toyama, 2005; Medhi, Prasad, & Toyama, 2007).\nSome research groups have also investigated the\nvalue of voice annotations and instructions, which\nare of obvious value to illiterate users (Parikh 2002;\nMedhi & Kuriyan, 2007; Medhi, Pitti, & Toyama,\n2005; Medhi, Prasad, & Toyama, 2007). Separately\nthere is a body of research that looks at the use of\nvoice auditory interfaces for information communi\ncation. However most of this work does not spe\nciacally target illiterate populations. In this stream\nthere are research papers that have demonstrated\nthe utility of auditory icons in addition to standard\ngraphical feedback in communicating information to\nusers (Blattner, Sumikawa, & Greenberg, 1989;\nGaver, 1989). This conarms our anding that graphi\ncal icons with voice annotation generally help users\nin speed of comprehension. Existing literature also\nsuggests that auditory icons are an intuitively acces\nsible way to use sound to provide multidimensional,\norganized information to users (Gaver, 1989a,\n1989b).\nSome authors researching illiterate populations\nnote the plausible inclusion of number, as illiterate\nusers are often numerate (Medhi, Pitti, & Toyama,\n2005; Parikh, 2002; Parikh, Ghosh, & Chavan,\n2003a, 2003b). Others focus on the need for ultra\nsimpliaed navigability as a design element (Gries\ndale, Graves, & Grunsteidl, 1997).\nOur work builds on many of these andings of\nthis previous work but also evolves the ideas further,\nparticularly in approach, design elements, and anal\nimplementation. Because this is a relatively new area\nof research for user-interface designers, interaction\nwith the target user groups is essential. Using con\ntextual design methods similar to that used by the\nresearch in rural microanance (Parikh, Ghosh, &\n\nTEXT-FREE USER INTERFACES FOR ILLITERATE AND SEMILITERATE USERS\nChavan, 2003b), we also spent a considerable\namount of time with our subjects. For each of our\napplications, we went through at least eight itera\ntions each of redesign and subject feedback. (Here\nwe are counting instances when there were funda\nmental changes in the UI; there were many addi\ntional separate occasions when small groups were\nconsulted for minor changes.)\nThis close interaction leads to some subtle and\nnot-so-subtle differences in design elements. The\nsubtle elements tend to be speciac to the applica\ntion domain and the target subjects. Previous work,\nfor example, does not cite action cues in graphics to\nindicate actions, but this may not arise in applica\ntions where icons only represent static objects. Our\nreliance on landmarks in maps is also something we\nchose when subjects were repeatedly unable to\ncomprehend standard map representations. A sig\nniacant requirement that previous work does not\nmention is the need for abundant and consistently\navailable help instructions. As we found ourselves\nrepeating the same background material and in\nstructions to our subjects each time we visited them,\nwe thought that this material could be encapsulated\ninto the application itself, and this addition had a\nprofound impact on the subjects' sense of\nautonomy.\nFinally, while all previous work suggests design\nelements, none mention the importance that these\nelements must be applied thoroughly across the ap\nplication. Even a single icon missing voice annota\ntion, for example, causes confusion, as subjects\nexpect to be able to point to any graphical compo\nnent and and out what it represents. Similarly, help,\nif it is made available, must be available all the time,\nor it will cause a loss in conadence among subjects\nwho tend to blame themselves for the interface's\nshortcomings.\nIn this article, we have presented two text-free user\ninterfaces applied to the particular applications of\nproviding information about employment opportuni\nties for domestic laborers and a digital map de\nsigned for illiterate and semiliterate subjects.\nThrough an extensive ethnographic design process\ninvolving more than 180 hours with 80 women and\nmen from three Bangalore slum communities, we\ndiscovered several design elements that were incor\nporated into the anal design, that we believe could\nbe applicable to other user groups that are illiterate\nand new to computer use. These include obvious\nand previously cited features such as graphical icons,\nvoice feedback on all functional units, minimal use\nof text, and active visual response on mouseover,\nbut also thus far unnoted features such as semiab\nstracted, instead of purely iconic graphics, and con\nsistent help for all application \"pages.\" Results also\nshowed that the text-free designs were strongly pre\nferred over standard text-based interfaces by the\ncommunities we addressed.\nToward the end of our work, for example, we\ndiscovered that some users fundamentally doubted\nthe ability of a cold piece of technology to deliver\nthe information they were interested in. We ob\nserved that in spite of our subjects' understanding\nof the UI mechanics, they experienced barriers be\nyond illiteracy in interacting with the computer: lack\nof awareness of what the PC could deliver, fear and\nmistrust of the technology, and lack of comprehen\nsion about how information relevant to them was\nembedded in the PC. We addressed these chal\nlenges with full-context video, which includes dra\nmatizations of how a user might use the application\nand how relevant information comes to be con\ntained in the computer, in addition to a tutorial of\nthe UI (Medhi & Toyama, 2007).\nSeparately we also conducted research toward an\nunderstanding of the optimal audio-visual represen\ntation for illustrating concepts for illiterate and semi\nliterate users of computers by comparing different\nrepresentational types in a way that fairly stacked\none representational type against the others (Medhi,\nPrasad, & Toyama, 2007). While we are not yet at\na point where we have achieved the goal of a truly\nassistance-less user interface for novice, illiterate\nuser, we believe this work takes us one step\ncloser. ■\nBlattner, M.
