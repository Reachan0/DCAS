It will focus both on models of economic growth and their empirical applications, and try to shed light on the mechanics of economic growth, technological change and sources of income and growth differences across countries.\n\nThe course has a number of objectives: The first is to familiarize you with a set of issues and questions that are central to macroeconomics, and that are also (hopefully) exciting and important; the second is to develop some of the most important tools of dynamic economics useful in macroeconomics as well as in a number of other subdisciplines of economics including general equilibrium theory, political economy, industrial organization and contract theory; and the third is to provide a first introduction to some of the key empirical issues in economic growth.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThe prerequisites for this course are\n14.451\n\nDynamic Optimization Methods with Applications\nor permission of the instructor.\n\nTextbook\n\nAcemoglu, Daron.\nIntroduction to Modern Economic Growth\n. Princeton University Press, 2009. ISBN: 9780691132921.\n\nGrading\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\nFour problem sets\n\n30%\n\nFinal exam\n\n70%\n\nCalendar\n\nLEC #\n\nTOPICS\n\nStylized Facts and Proximate and Fundamental Causes of Economic Development\n\nThis lecture will give a brief overview of the stylized facts of economic growth and show the large disparities in income per capita across countries. It will provide an example of how to investigate the relationship between a country level characteristic (in this instance democracy) and economic growth. It will also discuss briefly how the world distribution of income across countries has come to be so unequal.\n\n2-3\n\nIntroduction to the Solow Growth Model\n\nThe Solow growth model is a workhorse for many macro applications, and it is the starting place for the modern theory of economic growth. Here we begin with the basics of this model, which will already be familiar to many of you.\n\nThe Solow Model and the Data; Growth Accounting, Levels Accounting, and the Facts\n\nThis lecture uses the Solow growth model to interpret the stylized facts we encountered in the first lecture. In the process, we will also discuss a number of popular empirical strategies used in cross-country work and also the methodology of growth accounting.\n\n5-6\n\nNeoclassical Growth\n\nThe neoclassical growth model differs from the Solow growth model in incorporating consumer optimization. These collectors will first introduce the foundations of consumer optimization in dynamic economies and discuss the assumption of representative households. We will then study the equilibria and the Pareto optimal allocations in the workhorse neoclassical growth model. We will characterize both the steady state equilibrium and the dynamic equilibrium path of the economy starting from an arbitrary level of capital stock.\n\nOverlapping Generations and Dynamic Efficiency\n\nThe other workhorse model of dynamic macro is the overlapping generations model developed by Paul Samuelson and Peter Diamond. This lecture's focus is on this model. As a preliminary step, we'll discuss the first then the second welfare theorems in dynamic economies, and then turn to the overlapping generations model. This will enable us to understand sources of and conditions for dynamic inefficiency in overlapping generations model. We will also discuss various applications of overlapping generations models.\n\nNeoclassical Endogenous Growth: Capital Accumulation, Externalities, and Human Capital\n\nThis lecture will first present a model of sustained growth using a variant of the neoclassical growth model. Next I will present the first example of a model with endogenous growth due to the knowledge-base or the technology stock of the society expanding over time. Finally we will discuss the reasons why modeling sustained economic growth with externalities is unsatisfactory, and what special set of issues emerge in modeling technological change. The lecture will also briefly discuss the role of human capital in economic growth, and introduce some basic models that are useful for thinking about human capital investments.\n\n9-10\n\nEndogenous Growth with Expanding Input Varieties\n\nThese lectures will introduce the first models of endogenous technological change, where sustained economic growth takes place as a result of purposeful R&D-type activities. We will also briefly discuss some of the evidence on knowledge spillovers and externalities and the innovation process.\n\nInterdependences: Technology Diffusion, Trade and the World Income Distribution in an Open Economy\n\nThe models discussed up to this point in the class are closed economy models. These are not good approximations to the world we live in, where international trade and exchange of ideas are important. This lecture will provide an overview of major interdependences across countries that arise both because of technology diffusion and international trade. The emphasis will be on how these interdependences fundamentally affect the process of economic growth and the world distribution of income.\n\nDirected Technical Change: Endogenous Skill-Bias and Endogenous Labor-Augmenting Technological Change\n\nThis lecture will introduce models of directed technological change, where not only aggregate technological change, but the direction of technological change is endogenous. These models will enable us to discuss why and when technological change may be skill biased (favoring more educated workers), and why we may expect technological change to be labor augmenting.\n\nCompetition and Technological Change\n\nThis lecture will discuss the relationship between competition and technological change, and present some of the evidence related to this question.",

      "content": "14.452: Problem Set 2\nDue date: Friday, November 11, 2016 at midnight\nPlease only hand in Question 1, which will be graded.\nThe rest will be\nreviewed in the recitation but should not be handed in.\nQuestion 1: Consider a modified version of the continuous-time Solow\ngrowth model where the aggregate production function is\nF (K, L, Z) = LβKαZ1-α-β,\nwhere Z is land, available in fixed inelastic supply. Assume that α + β < 1,\ncapital depreciates at the rate δ, and there is an exogenous saving rate of s.\n1. First suppose that there is no population growth. Find the steady-state\ncapital-labor ratio and the steady-state output level. Prove that the steady\nstate is unique and globally stable.\n2. Show that, in the steady-state equilibrium, there is a monotonic relation-\nship between the interest rate and the saving rate of the economy. Using\nthis result, show that there exists a saving rate s∗such that above this,\nthe interest rate is negative. Show that when the interest rate is negative,\nstarting from the steady-state equilibrium, it is possible to reallocate re-\nsources so that consumption increases at all points in time. Explain what\nthis means and why such a possibility is present in this model.\n\n3. Now suppose that there is population growth at the rate n, that is, L/L =\nn. Does a steady-state equilibrium exists? What happens to the capital-\nlabor ratio and output level as t →inf? What happens to returns to land\nand the wage rate as t →inf?\n4. Would you expect the population growth rate n or the saving rate s to\nchange over time in this economy? If so, how? What other adjustments\nmight you expect in this economy as t →inf?\nQuestion 2: Consider the discrete-time Solow growth model with constant\npopulation growth at the rate n, no technological change and depreciation rate\nof capital equal to δ. Assume that the saving rate is a function of the capital-\nlabor ratio, thus given by s (k).\n\n1. Suppose that f (k) = Ak and s (k) = s0k-1-1. Show that if A+δ-n = 2,\nthen for any k (0) ∈(0, As0/ (1 + n)), the economy immediately settles\ninto an asymptotic cycle and continuously fluctuates between k (0) and\nAs0/ (1 + n) -k (0). [Suppose that k (0) and the parameters are given\nsuch that s (k) ∈(0, 1) for both k = k (0) and k = As0/ (1 + n) -k (0)].\n2. Now consider more general continuous production function f (k) and sav-\ning function s (k), such that there exist k1, k2 ∈R+ with k1 = k2 and\ns (k1) f (k1) + (1\nk2\n=\n-δ) k1\n1 + n\ns (k2) f (k2) + (1\nk1\n=\n-δ) k2 .\n1 + n\nShow that when such (k1, k2) exist, there may also exist a stable steady\nstate.\n3. Prove that such cycles are not possible in the continuous-time Solow\ngrowth model for any (possibly non-neoclassical) continuous production\nfunction f (k) and continuous s (k).\n4. What does the result in parts 1-3 imply for the approximations of discrete\ntime by continuous time in the Solow model (suggested in Section 2.4 of\nthe textbook)? What does this imply for the cycles in parts 1 and 2?\n5. Show that if f (k) is nondecreasing in k and s (k) = k, cycles as in parts\n1 and 2 are not possible in discrete-time either.\nQuestion 3: Consider the Solow growth model with constant saving rate s\nand depreciation rate of capital equal to δ. Assume that population is constant\nand the aggregate output is given by the CES production function\nF (AK (t) K (t) , AL (t) L) =\nh\nσ-1\nγ (AK (t) K (t))\nσ\n+ (1 -γ) (AL (t) L)\nσ-1\nσ\ni\nσ\nσ-1\n\nwhere AL (t) /AL (t) = gL > 0 and AK (t) /AK (t) = gK > 0.\nSuppose the\nelasticity of substitution between capital and labor is less than one, σ < 1,\nand capital-augmenting technological progress is faster than labor-augmenting\nprogess, gK ≥gL. Show that as t →inf, the economy converges to a BGP\nwhere the share of labor in national income is equal to 1, and capital, output\nand consumption all grow at the rate gL. In light of this result, discuss the\noften-made claim that capital-augmenting technological change is inconsistent\nwith balanced growth.\nQuestion 4: Consider the basic Solow model in continuous time and sup-\npose that A (t) = A, so that there is no technological progress of the usual\nkind. However, assume that the relationship between investment and capital\naccumulation is modified to\nK (t) = q (t) I (t) -δK (t) ,\nwhere [q (t)]inf\nt=0 is an exogenously given time-varying process. Intuitively, when\nq (t) is high, the same investment expenditure translates into a greater increase\n\nin the capital stock.\nTherefore, we can think of q (t) as the inverse of the\nrelative prices of machinery to output. When q (t) is high, machinery is relatively\ncheaper, and thus suppose that q (t) > 0.\n1. Suppose that q (t) /q (t) = γK > 0. Show that for a general production\nfunction, F (K, L), there exists no steady-state equilibrium.\n2. Now suppose that the production function is Cobb-Douglas, F (K, L) =\nKαL1-α, and characterize the unique steady-state equilibrium.\n3. Show that this steady-state equilibrium does not satisfy the Kaldor fact\nof constant K/Y . Is this a problem? [Hint: how is \"K\" measured in\npractice? How is it measured in this model?].\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n14.452 Economice Growth\nFall 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The rest will be\nreviewed in the recitation but should not be handed in.\nQuestion 1: Consider an economy consisting of N households each with\nutility function at time t = 0 given by\nX\ninf\nβtu\nt=0\nch (t)\n\n,\nwith β ∈(0, 1), where ch (t) denotes the consumption of household h at time t.\nSuppose that u (0) = 0. The economy starts with an endowment of y > 0 units\nof the final good and has access to no production technology. This endowment\ncan be saved without depreciating or gaining interest rate between periods.\n1. What are the Arrow-Debreu commodities in this economy?\n2. Characterize the set of Pareto optimal allocations of this economy.\n3. Explain why the Second Welfare Theorem can be applied to this economy.\nN\n4. Now P\nconsider an allocation of y units to the households,\nyh\n, such\nh=1\nN\nthat\nh=1 yh = y.\nGiven this allocation, find the unique\nequilibrium\n\ncomp\n\netitive\nprice vector and the corresponding consumption allocations.\n5. Are all competitive equilibria Pareto optimal?\n6. Now derive a redistribution scheme for decentralizing the entire set of\nPareto optimal allocations.\nQuestion 2:\nConsider the basic neoclassical growth model with CRRA\npreferences, but with consumer heterogeneity in initial asset holdings (you may\nassume no technological change if you wish). In particular, there is a set H of\nhousehold and household h ∈H starts with initial assets ah (0). Households are\notherwise identical.\n\n1. Characterize the competitive equilibrium of this economy and show that\nthe behavior of per capita variables is identical to that in a representative\nhousehold economy, with the representative household starting with assets\na (0) = |H|-1 R\na\nH\nh (0) dh, where |H| is the measure (number) of house-\nholds in this economy. Interpret this result and relate it to the Aggregation\nTheorem.\n2. Show that if, instead of the no-Ponzi condition, we impose ah (t) ≥0 for\nall h ∈H and for all t, then a different equilibrium allocation may result.\nIn light of this finding, discuss whether (and when) it is appropriate to\nuse a no-borrowing constraint instead of the no-Ponzi condition.\nQuestion 3: Consider the standard neoclassical growth model augmented\nwith labor supply decisions. In particular, there is a total population normalized\nto 1, and all individuals have utility function\nU (0) =\nZ inf\nexp (\n-ρt) u (c (t) , 1 -l (t)) ,\nwhere l (t) ∈(0, 1) is labor supply. In a symmetric equilibrium, employment\nL (t) is equal to l (t). Assume that the production function is given by Y (t) =\nF [K(t), A (t) L (t)], which satisfies all the standard assumptions and A (t) =\nexp (gt) A (0).\n1. Define a competitive equilibrium.\n2. Set up the current-value Hamiltonian that each household solves taking\nwages and interest rates as given, and determine the necessary and suffi-\ncient conditions for the allocation of consumption over time and leisure-\nlabor trade off.\n3. Set up the current-value Hamiltonian for a planner maximizing the utility\nof the representative household, and derive the necessary and sufficient\nconditions for an optimal solution.\n4. Show that the two problems are equivalent given competitive markets.\n5. Show that unless the utility function is asymptotically equal to\nu (c (t) ,\n-l (t)) =\n(\nAc(t)1-θ\nh(1\nl\n-θ\n-(t))\nfor θ =\n\n1,\nA log c (t) + Bh (1 -l (t))\nfor θ = 1,\nfor some h(·) with h′ (·) > 0, there will not exist a BGP with constant\nand equal rates of consumption and output growth, and a constant level\nof labor supply. Characterize such a BGP. Explain why this is the only\nfunctional form consistent with BGP.\n\n6. Imposing the utility function in part 5 above, characterize the dynamic\nequilibrium path of the economy starting with an arbitrary initial condi-\ntion k(0) > 0.\nQuestion 4: Consider the two-period canonical overlapping generations\nmodel with log preferences\nlog (c1 (t)) + β log (c2 (t + 1))\nfor each individual.\nSuppose that there is population growth at the rate n.\nIndividuals work only when they are young, and supply one unit of labor in-\nelastically. Production technology is given by\nα\nα\nY (t) = A (t) K (t) L (t) -,\nwhere A (t + 1) = (1 + g) A (t), with A (0) > 0 and g > 0.\n1. Define a competitive equilibrium and the steady-state equilibrium.\n2. Can you apply the First Welfare Theorem to this competitive equilibrium?\nCarefully explain your answer.\n3. Can you apply the Second Welfare Theorem? Be specific about how you\nwould decentralize the Pareto optimal allocations?\n4. Characterize the steady-state equilibrium and show that it is globally\nasymptotically stable.\n5. What is the effect of an increase in g on the equilibrium path?\n6. Suppose that the equilibrium involves r∗< n. Explain why the equilib-\nrium is referred to as \"dynamically inefficient\" in this case. Show that\nan unfunded Social Security system can increase the welfare of all future\ngenerations.\n7. Show that if r∗> n, then any unfunded Social Security system that\nincreases the welfare of the current old generation must reduce the welfare\nof some future generation.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n14.452 Economice Growth\nFall 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The rest will be\nreviewed in the recitation but should not be handed in.\nQuestion 1: Consider the following continuous-time neoclassical growth\nmodel:\nZ inf\n(c (t)) -θ -1\nU (0) =\nexp (\n-ρt)\n,\n1 -θ\nwith production function\nY (t) = A\nh\nσ-1\nL (t)\nσ\n+ K (t)\nσ-1\nσ\ni\nσ\nσ-1 .\n1. Define a competitive equilibrium for this economy.\n2. Set up the current-value Hamiltonian for an individual and characterize\nthe necessary conditions for consumer maximization. Combine these with\nequilibrium factor prices and derive the equilibrium path.\n3. Prove that the equilibrium is Pareto optimal in this case.\n4. Show that if σ ≤1, sustained growth is not possible.\n5. Show that if A and σ are sufficiently high, this model generates asymptot-\nically sustained growth due to capital accumulation. Interpret this result.\n6. Characterize the transitional dynamics of the equilibrium path.\n7. What is happening to the share of capital in national income? Is this\nplausible? How would you modify the model to make sure that the share\nof capital in national income remains constant?\n8. Now assume that returns from capital are taxed at the rate τ. Determine\nthe asymptotic growth rate of consumption and output.\n\nQuestion 2: Consider the following endogenous growth model due to Uzawa\nand Lucas. The economy admits a representative household and preferences are\ngiven by\nZ inf\nC (t) -θ\nexp (\n-ρt)\n-\ndt,\n1 -θ\nwhere C (t) is consumption of the final good, which is produced as\nα\nY (t) = AK (t) H1-α\nP\n(t)\nwhere K (t) is capital and H (t) is human capital, and HP (t) denotes human\ncapital used in production. The accumulation equations are as follows:\nK (t) = I (t) -δK (t)\nfor capital and\nH (t) = BHE (t) -δH (t)\nwhere HE (t) is human capital devoted to education (further human capital\naccumulation), and the depreciation of human capital is assumed to be at the\nsame rate, δ, as physical capital for simplicity. The resource constraints of the\neconomy are\nI (t) + C (t) ≤Y (t)\nand\nHE (t) + HP (t) ≤H (t) .\n1. Interpret the second resource constraint.\n2. Denote the fraction of human capital allocated to production by φ (t) (so\nthat φ (t) ≡HP (t) /H (t)) and calculate the growth rate of final output\nas a function of φ (t) and the growth rates of accumulable factors.\n3. Assume that φ (t) is constant, and characterize the BGP of the econ-\nomy (with constant interest rate and constant rate of growth for capital\nand output). Show that in this BGP, r∗≡B -δ and the growth rate\nof consumption, capital, human capital and output are given by g∗≡\n(B -δ -ρ) /θ. Show also that there exists a unique value of k∗≡K/H\nconsistent with BGP.\n4. Determine the parameter restrictions to make sure that the transversality\ncondition is satisfied.\n5. Now analyze the transitional dynamics of the economy starting with K/H\ndifferent from k∗[Hint: look at dynamics in three variables, k ≡K/H,\nχ ≡C/K and φ, and consider the cases α < θ and α ≥θ separately].\n\nQuestion 3:\nConsider an infinite-horizon economy that admits a represen-\ntative household with preferences at time 0 given by\nZ inf\nC (t) -θ\nexp (\n-ρt)\n-1dt.\n1 -θ\nPopulation is constant at L and labor is supplied inelastically. The unique final\ngood is produced with the production function\nY (t) =\n\"Z N(t)\nx(ν, t)1-βdν\n1 -β\n#\nLβ,\nwhere β ∈(0, 1), x(ν, t) denotes intermediate goods of type ν used in final\ngood production at time t, and N (t) is the number of intermediate good types\navailable at time t. Once a particular type of intermediate good is invented,\nit can be produced by using ψ units of final good. The innovation possibilities\nfrontier of the economy is\nN (t) = ηZ (t) ,\nwhere Z (t) is total amount of R&D spending, and resource constraint of the\neconomy is C (t) + X (t) + Z (t) ≤Y (t), where X (t) is spending on interme-\ndiate goods. There is free entry into research and a firm that invents a new\nintermediate good type receives a patent and becomes the monopolist producer\nof that good until the patent expires. Patents expire at the Poisson rate ι < inf,\nand once the patent on an intermediate good of a particular type is expired,\nit is produced competitively. The economy starts with N (0) > 0 intermediate\ngoods without patents.\n1. Define the equilibrium and balanced growth path (BGP) allocations.\n2. Characterize the BGP. [Hint: be explicit about the distribution of inter-\nmediate goods between firms with and without patents].\n3. Show that starting at time t = 0, the economy converges to the BGP.\nDoes it always grow at a constant rate?\n4. Show that an increase in ι reduces the BGP growth rate. Is this a realistic\nprediction? What types of alternatives for generalizations would you need\nto consider in order to reverse this prediction?\n5. Can an increase in ι be welfare improving? Explain your answer intuitively.\nQuestion 4: Consider the following endogenous growth model. Population\n\nat time t is L (t) and grows at the constant rate n (i.e., L (t) = nL (t)). All\nagents have preferences given by\nZ inf\nC(t)1-θ\nexp (\n-ρt)\n-1dt,\n1 -θ\n\nwhere C is consumption defined over the final good of the economy. This good\nis produced as\n1/β\nN(t)\nβ\nY (t) =\n\"Z\ny (ν, t) dν\n#\n,\nwhere y (ν, t) is the amount of intermediate good ν used in production at time\nt and N (t) denotes the number of intermediate goods available at time t. The\nproduction function of each intermediate is\ny (ν, t) = l (ν, t)\nwhere l (ν, t) is labor allocated to this good at time t. New goods are produced\nby allocating workers to the R&D process, with the production function\nN (t) = ηN φ (t) LR (t)\nwhere φ ≤1 andRLR (t) is labor allocated to R&D at time t. So labor market\nN(t)\nclearing requires\nl (ν, t) dv+LR (t) = L (t). Risk-neutral firms hire workers\nfor R&D. A firm who discovers a new good becomes the monopoly supplier, with\na perfectly and indefinitely enforced patent.\n1. Characterize the BGP in the case where φ = 1 and n = 0, and show that\nthere are no transitional dynamics. Why is this? Why does the long-run\ngrowth rate depend on θ? Why does the growth rate depend on L? Do\nyou find this plausible?\n2. Now suppose that φ = 1 and n > 0. What happens? Interpret.\n3. Now characterize the BGP when φ < 1 and n > 0.\nDoes the growth\nrate depend on L? Does it depend on n? Why? Do you think that the\nconfiguration φ < 1 and n > 0 is more plausible than the one with φ = 1\nand n = 0?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n14.452 Economice Growth\nFall 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Though\nthey are not necessary for endogenous technological change, it is\nplausible that they are quite sizable.\nA variety of diverse evidence is consistent with the importance of\nthese spillovers, but not always based on solid inference.\nPatent data and patent citation data can be used to investigate this\nquestion, as well as more generally as a very useful source of data in\nempirical work on innovation and technological change.\nEstimates of the spillovers that attempt to deal with major\nendogeneity issues and also spillovers taking place through product\nmarket competition suggest that knowledge spillovers are present and\nperhaps quite large.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nEconomic Growth Lectures 9 and 10\nNov. 29 and Dec. 1, 2016.\n92 / 93\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n14.452 Economic Growth\nFall 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Decisions in these models only concern investment in\nphysical capital. In reality, technological advances at the world level\nare not \"manna from heaven\".\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nEconomic Growth Lecture 11\nDecember 6, 2016. 2 / 43\n\nInternational Linkages\nIntroduction\nIntroduction II\nTechnology adoption involves many challenging features:\nEven within a single country, we observe considerable differences in the\ntechnologies used by different firms.\nIt is difficult to explain how in the globalized world some countries may\nfail to import and use technologies.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nEconomic Growth Lecture 11\nDecember 6, 2016. 3 / 43\n\nInternational Linkages\nProductivity Differences and Technology\nReview: Productivity and Technology Differences within\nNarrow Sectors I\nLongitudinal micro-data studies (often for manufacturing): even\nwithin a narrow sector there are significant and persistent productivity\ndifferences across plants.\nLittle consensus on the causes.\nCorrelation between plant productivity and plant or firm size, various\nmeasures of technology (in particular IT technology), capital intensity,\nthe skill level of the workforce.\nBut these correlations cannot be taken to be causal.\nBut technology differences appear to be an important factor.\nA key determinant seems to be the skill level of the workforce, though\nadoption of new technology does not typically lead to a significant\nchange in employment structure.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nEconomic Growth Lecture 11\nDecember 6, 2016. 4 / 43\n\nInternational Linkages\nProductivity Differences and Technology\nReview: Productivity and Technology Differences within\nNarrow Sectors II\nProductivity differences appear to be related to the entry of new and\nmore productive plants and the exit of less productive plants (recall\nSchumpeterian models).\nBut entry and exit account for only about 25% of average TFP\ngrowth, with the remaining accounted for by continuing plants.\nThus models in which firms continually invest in technology and\nproductivity are important for understanding differences across firms\nand plants and also across countries.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nEconomic Growth Lecture 11\nDecember 6, 2016. 5 / 43\n\nInternational Linkages\nTechnology Diffusion and Endogenous Growth\nTechnology Diffusion: Exogenous World Growth Rate I\nEndogenous technological change model with expanding machine\nvariety and lab equipment specification.\nAggregate production function of economy j = 1, ..., J at time t:\nYj (t) =\nN\n1 -β\nZ\nj(t)\nxj(v, t 1) -βdv\n\nL β\nj ,\n(1)\nLj is constant over time, x's depreciate fully after use.\nEach variety in economy j is owned by a technology monopolist; sells\nmachines embodying this technology at the profit maximizing (rental)\nprice px\nj (v, t).\nMonopolist can produce each unit of the machine at a cost of\nψ ≡1 -β units on the final good.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nEconomic Growth Lecture 11\nDecember 6, 2016. 6 / 43\n\nInternational Linkages\nTechnology Diffusion and Endogenous Growth\nTechnology Diffusion: Exogenous World Growth Rate II\nNo international trade, so firms in country j can only use technologies\nsupplied by technology monopolists in their country.\nEach country admits a representative household with the same\npreferences as before except nj = 0 for all j.\nResource constraint for each country:\nCj (t) + Xj (t) + ζjZj (t) ≤Yj (t) ,\n(2)\nζj: potential source of differences in the cost of technology adoption\nacross countries (institutional barriers as in Parente and Prescott,\nsubsidies to R&D and to technology, or other tax policies).\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nEconomic Growth Lecture 11\nDecember 6, 2016. 7 / 43\n\nInternational Linkages\nTechnology Diffusion and Endogenous Growth\nTechnology Diffusion: Exogenous World Growth Rate III\nInnovation possibilities frontier:\nN j (t) = ηj\nN (t)\nφ\nNj (t)\n\nZj (t) ,\n(3)\nwhere ηj > 0 for all j, and φ > 0 and is common to all economies.\nWorld technology frontier of varieties expands at an exogenous rate\ng > 0, i.e.,\nN (t) = gN (t) .\n(4)\nFlow profits of a technology monopolist at time t in economy j:\nπj (t) = βLj.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nEconomic Growth Lecture 11\nDecember 6, 2016. 8 / 43\n\nInternational Linkages\nTechnology Diffusion and Endogenous Growth\nSteady State Equilibrium I\nSuppose a steady-state (balanced growth path) equilibrium exists in\nwhich rj (t) is constant at rj\n∗> 0.

Then there exists a unique\nsteady-state world equilibrium in which growth at the world\nlevel is given by g ∗and all countries grow at this common\nrate. This growth rate is endogenous and is determined by\nthe technologies and policies of each country.

Growth for each country appears \"exogenous\", but\nthe growth rate of the world economy is endogenous.\nTechnological progress and economic growth are the outcome of\ninvestments by all countries in the world, but there are sufficiently\npowerful forces in the world economy through technological spillovers\nthat pull relatively backward countries towards the world average,\nensuring equal long-run growth rates for all countries in the long run.\nEqual growth rates are still consistent with large level differences\nacross countries.\nSeveral simplifying assumptions: same discount rates and focus on\nsteady-state equilibriua (transitional dynamics are now more\ncomplicated, since the \"block recursiveness\" of the dynamical system\nis lost).\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nEconomic Growth Lecture 11\nDecember 6, 2016. 19 / 43\n\nInternational Linkages\nTechnology Diffusion and Endogenous Growth\nTrade, Specialization and the World Income Distribution\nSimilar interdependences because of trade.\nModel based on Acemoglu and Ventura (2001).

Then equations (23) and (28) immediately imply that\nyj\n∗= μj\nh\nζj\n\nρ + g ∗i( -ε)/τ\nj\n.\n(29)\nGrowth at a common rate does not imply same level of income:\nCountries with better technology (high μj), lower distortions (low ζj)\nand lower discount rates (low ρj) will be relatively richer.\nElasticity of income with respect to ζj and ρj depends on elasticity of\nsubstitution between the intermediates, ε, and degree of openness, τ.\nWhen ε is high and τ is relatively low, small differences in ζj's and ρj's\ncan lead to very large differences in income across countries.\nRecall that in a world with a Cobb-Douglas aggregate production\nfunction and no human capital differences, the Solow model implies:\nyj\n∗= Aj\nsj\ng ∗\nα/(1-α)\n,\n(30)\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nEconomic Growth Lecture 11\nDecember 6, 2016. 39 / 43\n\nInternational Linkages\nTechnology Diffusion and Endogenous Growth\nDiscussion of Proposition: Steady State Equilibrium IV\nEquation (29) shows similar implications, except that:\nthe role of the labor-augmenting technologies is played by the\ntechnological capabilities of the country, which determine the range of\ngoods in which it has a comparative advantage;\nthe role of the saving rate is played by the discount rate ρj and the\npolicy parameter affecting the distortions on the production of\ninvestment goods, ζj;\ninstead of the share of capital in national income, the elasticity of\nsubstitution between intermediates and the degree of trade openness\naffects how spread out the world income distribution is.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nEconomic Growth Lecture 11\nDecember 6, 2016. 40 / 43\n\nConclusions\nConclusions\nMain Lessons I\nWe can make considerable progress in understanding technology and\nproductivity differences across nations by positing a slow process of\ntechnology transfer across countries, where technology in the less\nadvanced economies catches up only slowly to the frontier.\nAn important aspect of models of international technology diffusion is\nthat it necessitates an analysis of the world equilibrium, not simply\nthe equilibrium of each country on its own.\nAn important element of models of technology diffusion is that they\ncreate a built-in advantage for countries (or firms) that are relatively\nbehind, which ensures that differences between poor and rich nations\nwill be in terms of income level not growth rates.\nSimilar issues, arise because of trade interactions. Ricardian trade\nleads to similar dynamics to those obtained from ecological\ninterdependencies.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nEconomic Growth Lecture 11\nDecember 6, 2016. 41 / 43\n\nConclusions\nConclusions\nMain Lessons II\nMore realistic and richer trade models lead to a more complex\ndynamics.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nEconomic Growth Lecture 11\nDecember 6, 2016. 42 / 43\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n14.452 Economic Growth\nFall 2016\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Consistent with theory if the\nelasticity of substitution > 1, which Hanlon's estimates suggest.\nHanlon also provides evidence of strong relative bias- relative Indian\ncotton prices actually increased despite this input's relative\nabundance.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nEconomic Growth Lectures 12 and 13\nDecember 8 and 13, 2016.\n58 / 89\n\nDirected Technological Change with Knowledge Spillovers\nEvidence\nEvidence: Changes in Quantities\nCourtesy of W.

Suppose that δ < 1 and capital accumulates\naccording to (40). Then there exists no BGP.\nIntuitively, even though technological change is more labor\naugmenting than capital augmenting, there is still capital-augmenting\ntechnological change in equilibrium.\nMoreover it can be proved that in any asymptotic equilibrium, r (t)\ncannot be constant, thus consumption and output growth cannot be\nconstant.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nEconomic Growth Lectures 12 and 13\nDecember 8 and 13, 2016.\n65 / 89\n\nEndogenous Labor-Augmenting Technological Change\nLabor-Augmenting Change\nEndogenous Labor-Augmenting Technological Change V\nHowever, one special case works:\nProposition Consider the baseline model of directed technological change\nwith the two factors corresponding to labor and capital.\nSuppose that the innovation possibilities frontier is given by\nthe knowledge spillovers specification and extreme state\ndependence, i.e., δ = 1 and that capital accumulates\naccording to (40). Then there exists a constant growth path\nallocation in which there is only labor-augmenting\ntechnological change, the interest rate is constant and\nconsumption and output grow at constant rates. Moreover,\nthere cannot be any other constant growth path allocations.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nEconomic Growth Lectures 12 and 13\nDecember 8 and 13, 2016.\n66 / 89\n\nEndogenous Labor-Augmenting Technological Change\nLabor-Augmenting Change\nStability\nThe constant growth path allocation with purely labor augmenting\ntechnological change is globally stable if σ < 1.\nIntuition:\nIf capital and labor were gross substitutes (σ > 1), the equilibrium\nwould involve rapid accumulation of capital and capital-augmenting\ntechnological change, leading to an asymptotically increasing growth\nrate of consumption.\nWhen capital and labor are gross complements (σ < 1), capital\naccumulation would increase the price of labor and profits from\nlabor-augmenting technologies and thus encourage further\nlabor-augmenting technological change.\nσ < 1 forces the economy to strive towards a balanced allocation of\neffective capital and labor units.\nSince capital accumulates at a constant rate, a balanced allocation\nimplies that the productivity of labor should increase faster, and the\neconomy should converge to an equilibrium path with purely\nlabor-augmenting technological progress.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nEconomic Growth Lectures 12 and 13\nDecember 8 and 13, 2016.\n67 / 89\n\nEndogenous Labor-Augmenting Technological Change\nClimate Change and Endogenous Technological Change\nEconomic Analysis of Climate Change\nExisting economic analyses using computable general equilibrium\nmodels with exogenous technology (and climatological constraints;\ne.g., Nordhaus, 1994, 2002).\nKey issues: (1) economic costs and benefits of environmental policy;\n(2) costs of delaying intervention (3) role of discounting and risk\naversion.\nVarious conclusions:\nNordhaus approach: intervention should be limited and gradual; small\nlong-run growth costs.\nStern/Al Gore approach: intervention needs to be large, immediate\nand maintained permanently; large long-run growth costs.\nGreenpeace approach: only way to avoid disaster is zero growth.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nEconomic Growth Lectures 12 and 13\nDecember 8 and 13, 2016.\n68 / 89\n\nEndogenous Labor-Augmenting Technological Change\nClimate Change and Endogenous Technological Change\nEndogenous and Directed Technology\nVery different answers are possible.\nImmediate and decisive intervention is necessary (in contrast to\nNordhaus)\nTemporary intervention may be suffi cient (in contrast to Stern/Al Gore)\nLong-run growth costs may actually be very limited (in contrast to all\nof them).\nTwo instruments- not one- necessary for optimal environmental\nregulation.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nEconomic Growth Lectures 12 and 13\nDecember 8 and 13, 2016.\n69 / 89\n\nEndogenous Labor-Augmenting Technological Change\nClimate Change and Endogenous Technological Change\nWhy?\nTwo sector model with \"clean\" and \"dirty\" inputs with two key\nexternalities\nEnvironmental externality: production of dirty inputs creates\nenvironmental degradation.\nResearchers work to improve the technology depending on expected\nprofits and \"build on the shoulders of giants in their own sector\".\n→ Knowledge externality: advances in dirty (clean) inputs make their\nfuture use more profitable.\nPolicy interventions can redirect technological change towards\nclean technologies.\nDaron Acemoglu (MIT)\nEconomic Growth Lectures 12 and 13\nDecember 8 and 13, 2016.\n70 / 89\n\nEndogenous Labor-Augmenting Technological Change\nClimate Change and Endogenous Technological Change\nWhy?
