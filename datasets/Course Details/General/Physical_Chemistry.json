An electron is connected by a harmonic spring to a fixed point at\nx = 0. It is subject to a field-free potential energy\nV (x) = kx2 .\nThe energy levels and eigenstates are those of a harmonic oscillator where\n]1/2\nω = [k/me\nEv = }ω(v + 1/2)\nψv(x) = (v!)-1/2(a\nˆ+)vψv=0(x).\nNow a constant electric field, E0, is applied and V (x) becomes\nV (x) = 1 kx2 + E0ex (e > 0 by definition).\nNote on dipole interactions and signs:\nThe interaction energy of a charge q located at position x in a uniform DC electric\nfield E0 is aways\nH = -μE0 = -E0qx.\nNote the negative sign! This means that when a dipole, ~μ = q~x, points along the same di\nrection as an electric field, there is a favorable interaction (i.e. negative interaction energy).\nFor an electron, q = q - ≡-e, where e is the elementary charge and is strictly\ne\npositive, making the electron's charge negative. Therefore, an electron in a field in the +x\ndirection has an interaction expressed as\n~\nH = -μ~ · E0 = -E0qe- x = -E0(-e)x = +E0ex.\nAs the electron's position x increases, its interaction energy with the field increases (assum\ning E0 > 0, i.e. the field points in the +x direction). This makes physical sense: we know\nfrom 8.02 that an electron likes to go away from the direction that the field points (and\npositive charges like to go toward the direction of the field).\n5.61 Fall 2017\nProblem Set #6\nPage 1\n\nYou are going to approach this problem two ways:\n(i) by a simple and exact way first, and then\n(ii) by perturbation theory.\nA.

      "content": "5.61 Fall 2017\nProblem Set #9\nProblems 1 and 2 use the concept of \"electronegativity\" to analyze the strength of a polar AB\nbond and to contrast the π-bonding ability of C and Si. \"Electronegativity\" is closely related to\nthe ionization energy of an atomic orbital, and it is expressed in units of eV. You will need to\nuse non-degenerate perturbation theory to answer these questions. Electronegativity is a positive\nnumber. It is largest for an atom that has a large Ionization Energy.\n1. In this problem we want to approximate the strength of a two electron bond between two\natoms (A and B) with different electron negativities. Approximate the molecular orbitals as linear\ncombinations of one valence orbital on A and another valence orbital on B\nψ ≡ c1φA + c2φB .\nFor simplicity, assume that the atomic orbitals are approximately orthogonal\nZ\nS ≡\nφAφBdτ ≈ 0.\nA. We now want to approximate the energy of the AB bond for a fixed atom A bonding to different\npartners B with varying electronegativity. To this end, fix the electronegativity of atom A (εA)\nand allow the electronegativity of B (εB ) to vary freely.

Several of these problems require Gaussian calculations,\nwhich produce a \".log\" file detailing the results of the calculation. In order to receive full\ncredit for this problem set, you must submit the \".log\" files for your calculations electronically\nvia the 5.61 website. While we encourage you to work together on these problems, each\nstudent is expected to run their own calculations.\n3. In this problem we're going to familiarize ourselves with using Gaussian by finding the equilib\nrium structure of a single methanol molecule.\nA. Make a reasonable guess at the structure of CH3OH using GaussView. Then, determine the\nequilibrium structure of the molecule in the Hartree-Fock (HF) approximation using the 6-31G(d,p)\nbasis.

In this\nproblem, we will use various methods to approximate the energy released by this reaction.\nΔE-E(CH3OH) +\nE(O2) - E(CO2) - 2 E(H2O)\nA.

First, let us see whether\nthe basis set is the problem. Choose a larger basis set than 6-31G(d,p) for this system and justify\n5.61 Fall 2017\nProblem Set #9\nPage 3\n\nwhy you chose this basis. Now, compute the reaction energy in this basis. Does a larger basis\nsignificantly change your answer?

Use density functional\ntheory (DFT) to compute the reaction energy. Does DFT bring your answer into closer agreement\nwith experiment? What do you take home from this exercise? [Note: in this part, you may use an\nenergy functional and basis set of your choice, but you must justify your choice.]\n5. One of the most important intermolecular interactions in chemistry is the hydrogen bond. In\nparticular, hydrogen bonding in water is an extremely important topic. In this problem, we will\nstudy the hydrogen bond between two water molecules.\nA. Compute the length, R, of a hydrogen bond between two water molecules using B3LYP in a\n6-31G(d,p) basis.

A baseball has diameter = 7.4 cm. and a mass of 145g. Suppose the baseball is moving at\nv = 1nm/second.

However, the large mass of the baseball (it is on the\nmacroscopic scale, not atomic) means that the ball has an extremely large momentum in terms of\nquantum mechanical problems, leading to an extremely small de Broglie wavelength.\nThe ball will NOT diffract off the bat because the λball is ∼ 23 orders of magnitude smaller than\nthe bat.\nB. How might you measure the velocity of a baseball moving at v ≈ 1nm/sec?\nSolution:\nBecause the ball is moving so slowly, traditional techniques (doppler radar, high speed cameras\nwith length scales) will be unable to measure the speed of the ball (even modern equipment can't\nmeasure such minute differences). Multiple possible schemes exist, but here is one possible setup:\n- use coherent -- nm x-ray source -- monochromatic, in-phase x-rays\n- when light path from baseball→detector and mirror→detector differ by an integer number of\nwavelengths, we see constructive interference.\n- when these paths differ by 1 (integer wave-length) we see destructive interference.\n- We see alternating bright and dark regions on the detector.\nCoherent x-ray\nsource\nmirror\n\n↓\n\n∧\n\nbeam splitter (half-silvered mirror)\n\n>\nhhhhh< hhhhhh\n>\n\n↓\nλx-ray\nvball =\nΔt\ninterfence peaks\n5.61 Fall 2017\nProblem Set #1 Solutions\nPage 3\n\n3.

(6 points)\nWithout doing any calculation, are the energy levels that are affected\nby the -αδ(Q) term shifted up or down?\nThe δ-function acts as an extra well, resulting in a stabilization of all of the odd-v/odd-\nsymmetry levels. Another way of answering is that the Ev\n(1) = Hvv\n(1) term is negative for all\nodd-v levels, therefore all of these states are lowered in energy. Another answer is that\nall non-zero matrix elements of Hv,v-1\n(1) , appear with a negative energy denominator in\nEi\n(2) =\nj=i∑\nHij\n(\n)\nEi\n(0) -E j\n(0) .\n\nC. (6 points)\nWithout doing any calculation, among the levels that are affected by\nthe -αδ(Q) term, is the magnitude of the energy shift larger or\nsmaller for a low-v vs. a high-v level?\nThe energy shift is larger for a low-v level than for a high-v level. This is a general rule\nfor tunneling. Then there is another way of answering. The diagonal and off-diagonal\nelements of αδ(Q) are α 2 ψv(0)ψ ʹv (0)\nEv\n(0) -E ʹv\n(0)\n. Since the perturbation term depends on the\nvalue of ψodd-v(0)ψodd- ʹv (0) and the HO wavefunction have a decreasing with-v amplitude\nat Q = 0 because the kinetic energy and classical |momentum| is largest at Q = 0. The\nψv(0) values decrease with v, so the level shift decreases with v.\n\nD.

There are two ways to justify\nyour answer to part C: (1) using perturbation theory, or (2) by\nadjusting the phase of the energy-shifted ψv(Q) at the turning points\n[Q±, where Ev = V(Q±)] so that ψ(± inf) = 0.\nQ\nor\nψv\n\n5.61 Final Examination ANSWERS\nFall, 2017\nPage 3\n\nrevised 12/19/17 3:15 PM\nYour justification of your answer to part C should be based on how\nthe magnitude of the discontinuity in dψ\ndQ at Q = 0 affects the size of\nthe energy level shift relative to the energy of the vth harmonic\noscillator level, ωe(v + 1/2).\nThe answers involving perturbation theory have been stated in Part C. The answer that\ndeals explicitly with the discontinuity of the derivative of ψ at Q = 0 is based on the\nrequirement that ψv(±inf) = 0. This is achieved when ψv(Q±) and δψv δQ Q=Q± [Q± are the\nturning points, where Ev = V(Q±)] have the unique correct value so that ψv(Q±) can satisfy\nthe Q = ±inf boundary condition. The -αδ(Q) form creates a cusp in ψv(odd-v) that has\nthe form of too much accumulation of phase at Ev\n(0) that is corrected by lowering the\nenergy, thereby removing the extra accumulated phase. If we had a +αδ(Q) perturbation,\nthe opposite behavior of too little accumulated phase would result and the energy must be\nincreased to compensate.\n\nE.

IR Spectroscopy Under a Deadline\n(50 points)\n\nYou have a contract with the Army Research Office (ARO) to determine the equilibrium\nbond length (re), vibrational frequency (ωe), and electric dipole moment (μe1) of the electronic\nground state of TAt (tritium astatide). Your contract terminates tomorrow and you must write\na final report today. Last night, on your desperate final attempt to record the vibration-\nrotation spectrum of TAt in an electric field of 100,000 Volts/cm, you obtained a\nspectrum unlike any you had observed previously. You suspect that this spectrum is that\nof the TAt v = 1 ← v = 0 transition, but you have no additional scheduled experimental\ntime on the hyper-IPECAC facility, which is the only Astatine source (210At85 has a half\nlife of 8.3 hours) in the world that is capable of generating the At flux needed for your\nexperiment. Therefore you must write your final report to ARO without doing any further\nexperiments to verify whether your spectrum is that of TAt or some other molecule. The\nlikely other molecules include At2, T2, HAt, DAt, HT, and DT (you may ignore all other\npossibilities here). Your continued funding by ARO depends on the timely submittal of\nyour report, but your career depends on its correctness.\n\nOne of your research assistants has provided you with the following possibly useful\ninformation:\n\nAtomic Weight H\n1.00782\nIonization Potentials\nH\n109,677.581 cm-1\n\nD\n2.01410\n\nF\n140,553.5 cm-1\n\nT\n3.01605\n\nCl\n104,991 cm-1\n\nAt\n210.0\n\nBr\n95,550 cm-1\n\nI\n84,340 cm-1\n\nAt\nunknown\n\n\"Covalent Radius\"\nH\n0.32A\n\n\"Ionic Radius\"\nH-\n2.08A\n\nF\n0.72A\n\nF-\n1.36A\n\nCl\n0.99A\n\nCl-\n1.81A\n\nBr\n1.14A\n\nBr-\n1.95A\n\nI\n1.33A\n\nI-\n2.16A\n\nAt\n1.45A\n\nAt-\nunknown\n\nGround State\n\nωe\nRe\nμe\nHF\n1∑\n\n4138.32 cm-1\n0.9168 A\n1.8262 Debye\nHCl\n1∑\n\n2990.95 cm-1\n1.2746 A\n1.1085 Debye\nHBr\n1∑\n\n2648.98 cm-1\n1.4144 A\n0.8265 Debye\nHI\n1∑\n\n2309.01 cm-1\n1.6092 A\n0.4477 Debye\nHAt\nunknown\n------\n------\n-------\nF2\n1∑g\n\n916.64 cm-1\n1.4119 A\n-------\nCl2\n1∑g\n\n559.72 cm-1\n1.9879 A\n-------\n\n5.61 Final Examination ANSWERS\nFall, 2017\nPage 8\n\nrevised 12/19/17 3:15 PM\nBr2\n1∑g\n\n325.321 cm-1\n2.2811 A\n-------\nI2\n1∑g\n\n214.50 cm-1\n2.6663 A\n-------\nAt2\nunknown\n-------\n--------\n-------\nH2\n1∑g\n\n4401.21 cm-1\n0.7414 A\n-------\n\nSome useful conversion formulas (Be is in cm-1, μ is in atomic mass units, and Re is in A,\nand 1 cm = 108A):\n\nReduced Mass\nμ(XY ) = M XMY\nM X + MY\namu\n(\n)\nωe =\n2πc\nk\nμ\n\n(cm-1)\n\nBe = 1.6858×10-15\nμRe\n\n(cm-1)\nIn the absence of an electric field, the vibrational rotational energy is given by:\nEvJ hc =ωe v+1/ 2\n(\n)-ωexe v+1/ 2\n(\n)2 + Be -αe v+1/ 2\n(\n)\n[\n]J(J +1).\ncm-1\n(\n)\nBefore analyzing your spectrum and writing your report to ARO, it would be a good idea to\nmake some predictions about the spectroscopic properties of TAt.\nPLEASE NOTE: Many parts of this question can be answered even if you are unable to\nanswer an earlier part.\n\nA.

Assume αe ≈ 0 and\nωexe ≈ 0 and use your assigned lines to determine ωe and Be. Could this\nbe TAt?\nI have given the low-J assignments in the answer to Part C. The key feature to notice is\nthe \"zero-gap\" between the lines at 1122.24 and 1129.70 cm-1. This gap identifies the\nlowest-J lines in the R and P branches. It also tells us that the transition is 1∑ - 1∑, not\n1∏ - 1∏. The zero gap would be larger for a 1∏ - 1∏ transition. There would also be a\nmoderately strong Q(1) line near the middle of the zero-gap.\n\nLooking good for TAt.\n\nE.

Could your spectrum be due to any of the other\nlikely candidate molecules?\nThe rotational and vibrational constants for the observed transition are too small for the\nmolecule to be HAt or DAt. This is a huge effect.\n\nThe rotational and vibrational constants for HT and DT are vastly too large for a\nplausible assignment of the observed spectrum to HT or DT. The Stark effect will also\nbe very, very small for HT and DT.\n\nThe dipole moment for the putative TAt spectrum will be small, much smaller due to that\nfor TI or DI.\n\nThe small μe will be an excellent confirmation of the TAt assignment.\n\n5.61 Final Examination ANSWERS\nFall, 2017\nPage 12\n\nrevised 12/19/17 3:15 PM\nFor Question IV.G: The v = 1 ←v = 0 spectrum consists of a series of absorption lines\nfollowing the selection rule ΔJ = ±1 (R and P branches).

Justify your answer.\nKey points: σu*(2s) is more anti-bonding than σg(2s) is bonding. The interaction between\nσg(2p) and σg(2s) will make σg(2s) more bonding. The interaction between σu*(2p) and\nσu*(2s) will have a small effect on reduction of anti-bonding character because of a much\nlarger energy denominator.\n\nThe expectation is that the single bond from σg(2s)2 will be almost perfectly cancelled by\nthe single anti-bond from σu*(2s)2. The ground state of Be2 is likely to be unbound.\n\n(b) (2 points) Do you expect that the lowest energy excited state of\nBe2 is bound? Justify your answer.\nThe first excited state will involve promotion of an electron from the σu*(2s) orbital to\nthe σg(2p) orbital.

It is possible that the\nπu(2p)→σg(2p) promotion energy is small relative to the e-- e- repulsion due to 4\nelectrons in the πu(2p) orbital.

Recall that the orbital ionization energy roughly\ndetermines the orbital radius and that the probability density in an\norbital is proportional to r-3.\nWhy is the bonding so different between N2 and P2? There is no simple correct answer to\nthis question. Several factors are relevant:\n\n1)\nThe orbital size decreases as ionization energy increases. The orbitals on N are\nsmaller than the corresponding orbitals on P. This suggests that Re will be larger\nfor P2.\n2)\nOrbital density decreases as orbital size increases. This means that bonding (ωe)\nwill be weaker for P2.\n3)\nThe largest and most directed orbital is σ(2p). If there is only one bond for P2, it\nwill be from σg(2p)2.\n4)\nThe larger size of the valence MOs on P2 suggest that a smaller fraction of the\nelectrons are in the region along the bond axis between the two atoms.

Suggest a\npossible explanation for why the lowest energy state for Ca comes\nfrom the [Ar]4s2 configuration and the lowest energy state for Sc+\ncomes from the [Ar]4s13d1 configuration.\nOne acceptable answer is provided. A large positive contribution to EB - EA comes from\nJ4s4s. Sc2+ has the same electrons, but a higher nuclear and effective charge than Ca. The\n4s orbital for Ca is farther from the nucleus and thus, larger, which means that J4s4s is\nsmaller for Ca. This may be enough to shift the inequality to\n\nEB - EA < 0\n\nPhysically, this means that electron repulsion drives the second valence electron out of\nthe 4s orbital and into the 3d orbital in the case of Sc2+.\n\nG.

The more ψj (x)\nwavefunctions we use in describing Ψ(x, 0), the sharper we can make the t = 0 wavepacket.\nThere are several experimentally or pictorially simple schemes for creating a wavepacket,\nwhich is a superposition of eigenstates of bH that have different values of Ej (needed in order\nto have any motion at all).\nCreate a non-eigenstate at t = 0\n. . .\n...\n. .\n.... .. . . . . . . .\n.\n.\n.\n.\nHalf Harmonic Oscillator, barrier at x = 0.\n.\n.\nRemove barrier at t = 0\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n. . .\n.\n. . . . . .\nTo make such a t = 0 wavepacket, we can use any of the ψ2v+1 (odd) eigenstates that\nhave a node at x = 0.

Usually,\nin order to make life simple, we choose only 3 ψv to create a Ψ(x, t = 0) with approximately\nthe correct shape\nΨ(x, 0) = c0ψ0(x) + c1ψ1(x) + c2ψ2(x).\nThis will have a node at x = 0 and larger probability for x < 0 than for x > 0.\nhxˆit = 2c0c1x01 cos ωt + 2c1c2x12 cos ωt.\nNote that x00, x11, x22, and x02, are all zero because of the Harmonic Oscillator Δv = ±1\nselection rule for ˆx.

The second two terms are oscillatory. The second\ntwo terms can be re-expressed as\n\n2Re c1\n*c2e-i(E2-E1)t ψ1\n*ψ 2\n⎡⎣\n⎤⎦\nRe means \"the real part.\" If C is a complex number\n\nReC = 1\n2 C + C*\n(\n)\n\nand in the above Ψ\n∗Ψ equation, the fourth term is the complex conjugate of the third term\n(see McQuarrie, Chapter A) and\n\nω12 = E1\n-E2\n.\n\nFor the special case that c1\n* = c2 = 2-1/2 and ψ1 and ψ2 are real\n\nΨ*(x,t)Ψ(x,t) = 1\n2 ψ1\n2 + 1\n2 ψ 2\nstatic\n\n+ cosω12t\n(\n) ψ1ψ 2\nregions of\n+ and -\namplitude\n\n.\n\nIt is clear that the only way we get motion is from a Ψ(x,t) that contains at least two\neigenfunctions of ˆH that belong to two different energy eigenvalues. The TDSE is the only\nway we make contact with the familiar world of moving objects.\n\n5.61 Fall 2017\nLecture #10\npage 4\n\nrevised 8/7/17 11:25 AM\n\nThere are several easily computed observable dynamical properties that we can use to gain\ninsight into the ways in which Quantum Mechanics encodes motion and to discover what are\nthe Quantum Mechanical laws for motion.\n\n2)\nIf we integrate Ψ*(x,t)Ψ(x,t) over x, we have a simple normalization integral. Since\nprobability is conserved, the normalization integral should not be (and is not) time-\ndependent, no matter how many ψi are present in Ψ. For the two-state superposition state\n\n∫dxΨ*(x,t)Ψ(x,t) = c1\n2 + c2\n2 !\nProbability is conserved (and orthogonality simplifies matters).\n\nThe c1\n*c2ψ1\n*ψ 2 terms go away because ψ1 is orthogonal to ψ2. The |ψ1|\n2 and |ψ2|\n2 terms become\n1 because the ψi are normalized to 1.\n\n3)\nExpectation values of ˆx and ˆp .

It\noften helps to shift the box so that it goes from -a/2 < x < a/2 (symmetric) rather than 0 < x <\na. For all PIB, x11 = x22 = xcenter of box, but x12 = 0 if both quantum numbers are even or both are\nodd. WHY? The only case where 〈x〉t is time-dependent for PIB is when Ψ contains at least\none even-n and one odd-n eigenstate. We also saw this for the wave equation.\n\nWhat about ˆp t ? It is possible to show (you should show this) that whenever ˆx t is time-\ndependent, so too is ˆp t and\n\n5.61 Fall 2017\nLecture #10\npage 5\n\nrevised 8/7/17 11:25 AM\n\nm d x t\ndt\n= p t ,\n\nwhich is one of Newton's laws.

For every eigen-energy Ei there is an eigenfunction ψi. We have\njust seen that the exact solution to the simplest possible problem, the two-level problem,\nis algebraically challenging. We can approach this problem in a matrix formulism, which\nturns out to be the most powerful and insight-generating approach to the vast majority of\nquantum mechanical problems. The matrix Hamiltonian is\n\nE 0\nΔ\nV\nH =\n+\n= E1 + H0 .\n0 E\nV\n-Δ\nH0 is a real and symmetric matrix. We have subtracted the average energy from the original\nH. We can always do this. The essential structure of the problem is in H0 . We will call this\nH from now on. The \"elements\" of this matrix are\nH11 = Δ\nH22 = -Δ\nH12 = H21 = V.\n[Does everyone know the rules for matrix multiplication?]\nN\nX\n(AB)mn =\nAmj Bjn\nj=1\nThis H matrix operates on vectors ci where i = 1 and 2 for the two-level problem\n\nc = 0\n\nc = 1\n\n(c 1)T c 1 = 1\n1 = 1 where T means \"transpose\".

In this case, we have\na1 = Δ ,\na2 = V.\nThis is exactly what we saw previously in the wavefunction picture where, left multiplying\nby ψ1\n? and integrating\nZ\nZ\nZ\nψ1\n? b\n=\n1 ψ1dτ +\na2ψ1\n?ψ2dτ\nHψ1dτ\na1ψ?\nH11 = a11 + a20\na1 = H11 = Δ.\nAlso, multiplying by ψ2\n? and integrating\nZ\nψ? b\n2Hψ1dτ = a10 + a21 ,\na2 = H21 = V.\nThe key point here is that we never actually look at the {ψi}. We start with all of the\n\"matrix elements\" of Hb evaluated in the complete {ψi} basis set.\nNext we solve for the energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors using the matrix formalism.\nWe want to find the eigenvalues of the H matrix. There must exist a unitary trans\nformation of H that \"diagonalizes\" it. We are going to use a special class of 2 × 2 matrices\nthat have the property\n\nT+ = T-1\nor\nT-1T =\n= 1\n\nT11 T12\nT = T21 T22\n\nT ?\nT ?\nT+\n= T ?\nT ?\n.\nT+ means \"conjugate transpose\". For a real symmetric matrix, H, we can forget about the\ncomplex conjugate and use TT (transpose) rather than T+ .\nNow, for the matrix version of the Schr odinger Equation:\nHc = Ec.\nInsert\n1 = TTT\nHTTT c = Ec\n\n5.61 Fall 2017\nLectures #13 & #14\nPage 7\nand left-multiply by TT\n(TT HT)(TT c) = E(TT c)\ne\nTT HT = H (the transformed H)\nTT c = c\n(the transformed c).\nWe say that T \"diagonalizes\" H\n\ne\nE1\nH =\nE2\n\ne\nc 1 = 1\nan eigenvector of H\n\ne\nE1\nE1\nH c =\n=\n= E1\nE2\nTT\n1st\nc = c\ncolumn of TT\n\nT T\nT T\nT T\nTT 1\nc =\n=\n, notation: Trow, column\nT T\nT T\nT T\nthus\n\nH\ne c 1 = E1 1\nand\n\ne\n= E2\nH c 2\n,\nwhich is consistent with\ne c = E c,\nH\ni is ith\ne\nand the eigenvector c\ncolumn of TT , where H = T+HT.

The best way to convince yourself is by a few numerical\nexamples, e.g. Δ = 1, V = 0.1, then Δ = 1, V = 1, and finally Δ = 1, V = 10.\n\n5.61 Fall 2017\nLectures #13 & #14\nPage 9\nIV.\nBeyond the Two-Level Problem: N > 2 levels\nThe eigen-energies for the two-level problem (2 × 2 H) are obtained as the solutions of a\nquadratic equation. The quadratic formula gives the two exact energy levels.\nThere are N eigen-energies for the N-level problem (N × N H). No analytic formula\nexists that can provide the N values of {Ei} as explicit functions of the {Hij } matrix ele\nments. However, exact values of each member of the set of N {Ei} are obtained iteratively by\na variety of matrix diagonalization computer programs. We never need to concern ourselves\nwith the algebraic complexities of finding the N eigen-energies {Ei} and eigenfunctions {ψi}\nor eigenvectors {ci} of an N × N H matrix or the N coupled linear homogeneous equations\nthat arise from Hb . All we need is a \"complete\" set of \"basis functions\" {φi} with which to\nevaluate all Hij matrix elements.\nThese complete sets of basis functions {φi} are almost always the eigenfunctions of one\nof our exactly solved problems (particle in a box, harmonic oscillator, rigid rotor, Hydrogen\natom) and we have already seen several examples of problems where all {Hij } are derived\nsemi-automatically and are expressed in terms of fundamental structural parameters. So\nnow we are beginning to understand the relationship between what we want to know, the\nmolecular constants, and what we are allowed to measure via the {Ei} and {ψi}.\nThere are some easily verified facts about N × N H problems.\n1. There are N eigen-energies (some might be degenerate).\n2. There are N linearly independent eigen-functions or eigen-vectors, each explictly re\nlated to one of the eigen-energies.\n3. The eigen-functions and eigen-vectors can be put into orthogonal and normalized form:\n\"ortho-normal\"\nZ\nψi\n?ψj dτ = δij\n(Kronecker δ)\n⎛\n⎞\nj\nc\n⎜\n⎜\n⎜\n⎝\n⎟\n⎟\n⎟\n⎠\nj\n\nc\niT j\ni\ni\ni\n= δij .\nc\nc = c\nc\nc\n. . .\nN\n. . .\njcN\nAll eigen-functions that belong to non-degenerate eigen-values are born orthogonal.\nThose that belong to degenerate eigen-values can be transformed into orthogonal form.\n\n5.61 Fall 2017\nLectures #13 & #14\nPage 10\n4.

Even the most pow\nerful computer in the world cannot diagonalize an infinite dimension H matrix. Perturbation\nTheory provides approximate (of a priori known accuracy) eigen-energies and eigen-vectors,\neven for an infinite dimension H. Perturbation Theory is a basis for both accurate numerics\nand for physical insight.\n\n5.61 Fall 2017\nLectures #13 & #14\nPage 12\nV.\nPrelude to Perturbation Theory\nWe return to the two-level problem and derive some equations for\nE±\nand ψ±\nthat foreshadow Rayleigh-Schr odinger non-degenerate perturbation theory:\nNon-Lecture\nDerive an equation for θ in terms of V and Δ:\n\nΔ\nV\nH11 + H22\nH11 - H22\nH = E +\nrecall E =\n, Δ =\nV\n-Δ\n\ncos θ - sin θ\nT =\nsin θ\ncos θ\n\ne\nE+\nH = E1 + TT HT = E1 +\nE-\nWhat does TT E1T yield?\n\n(c2 - s2)Δ + 2csV\n(c2 - s2)V - 2csΔ\nwhere TT HT =\n.\n(c2 - s2)V - 2csΔ -(c2 - s2)Δ - 2csV\nThe transformation TT HT corresponds to a rotation of H in state space and θ is\ncalled the \"mixing angle\".

How are the quantities we want to know in order to form an intuitive physical picture\nof the molecule related to what we can measure in a do-able experiment.\n\nSpectroscopy! Everything we might want to know about a molecule is encoded in the spectrum.\nFor example, we never directly measure a bond length or a force constant.\n\nPerturbation Theory tells us how the quantity we are interested in expresses itself in a do-able\nexperiment.\n\nPerturbation Theory:\n\nugly but useful\ngives us energy level formulas: E(quantum numbers)\ndefines molecular constants\nconversion of directly calculable R-dependent quantities into directly measureable\nquantum number dependent quantities\nE(quantum numbers ) = ∑(molecular constants)(quantum numbers)\n\nOne example:\n\nEvib v1,v2\n(\n) = hc !ω1 v1 +1/ 2\n(\n)+ !ω2 v2 +1/ 2\n(\n)\n⎡⎣\n+ωx\n\"11 v1 +1/ 2\n(\n)\n2 +ωx\n\" 22 v2 +1/ 2\n(\n)\n2 +ωx\n\"12 v1 +1/ 2\n(\n) v2 +1/ 2\n(\n)⎤⎦\n\nv1, v2 are quantum numbers\n\n!ω1, !ω2,ωx\n\"11,ωx\n\"12,ωx\n\"22 are molecular constants [How are these vibrational molecular\nconstants related to the atomic masses and the potential energy function, V(R1, R2, R12)?]\n\n5.61 Fall, 2017\nLecture 15\nPage 2\nrevised 10/16/17 3:34 PM\nAnother example: the Stark Effect. How does an external electric field interact with the electric\ndipole moment of a molecule to shift and split the rotational energy levels of a diatomic\nmolecule?\n\nE J,M J;ε\n(\n) = hc BvJ(J +1)+ με\n(\n)\n2 f (J,M J )\n⎡⎣\n⎤⎦\n\nwhere μ is the electric dipole moment (what we want to know), ε is the electric\nfield, and f(J,MJ) is a complicated algebraic function expressed in terms of Bv, J,\nMJ, which you will derive using perturbation theory.\n\nFormal derivation of perturbation theory\n\nHψ = Eψ\nH = H(0) + λH(1) + λ2H(2)\nusually we\nignore this\n\nEn = En\n(0) + λEn\n(1) + λ2En\n(2)\nψ n = ψ n\n(0) + λψ n\n(1) + λ2ψ n\n(2)\nusually we\nignore this\n\nH(2) is ignored because we decide to put all bad stuff into H(1). This is a choice dictated by\nconvenience.\n\nψ n\n(2) is ignored because we observe energy levels, not wavefunctions, and it will be clear that\nenergy terms calculated using ψ n\n(2) will be very small.\n\nλ is an \"order-sorting\" or \"smallness\" parameter that guides us through the derivation.\n(MOSTLY) NON-LECTURE: Derivation of Perturbation Theory Formulas\n\nH(0) + λH(1) + λ2H(2)\n[\n] ψ n\n(0) + λψ n\n(1) + λ2ψ n\n(2)\n⎡⎣\n⎤⎦\n= En\n(0) + λEn\n(1) + λ2En\n(2)\n⎡⎣\n⎤⎦ψ n\n(0) + λψ n\n(1) + λ2ψ n\n(2)\n⎡⎣\n⎤⎦\n\narrange the terms into three separate equations according to the power of λ.

However, we can often obtain\nthis sign from a cross term between rotation and vibration.\n\nThe effective potential is given by\n\n5.61 Fall 2017\nLecture 16S\nPage 2\nrevised 10/30/17 2:37 PM\nV Q\n( ) = 1\n2 kQ2 + 1\n6 aQ3 + hcB(R)J(J +1)\n\nFirst we must express B(R) as a power series in Q.
