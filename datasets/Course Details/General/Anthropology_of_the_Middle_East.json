      "content": "Susan Slyomovics\n>As ig ma>bad (The Passion of Ma>bad): The Epic Confronts Hilali\nHistory\nWhy did the Bani Hilal Bedouin Arab tribes depart their ancestral\nlands in the Arabian peninsula to march westward against North Africa?\nBeginning in the eighth century with westward migrations to Egypt, by the\neleventh century their descent on the Maghreb would be compared to\n\"clouds of locusts.\" This famous description of the Hilalis North African\nincursions characterizes the influential analysis proposed by fourteenth\ncentury historian Ibn Khaldun, who sought the causes of the Hilali invasion\nin the complex political intrigues that opposed Egyptian and Tunisian\nrulers: when al-Mu>izz Ibn Badiμs, ruler of Ifriqiyya, switched allegiance\nfrom Cairo to the >Abbasid Caliph of Baghdad, the Egyptian Fatimid\nleaders sought vengeance by unleashing the Hilali tribes against Tunis.\nScholars also point to severe cyclical famines in the Arabian peninsula\nwhich historically have contributed to waves of tribes migrating westward\ntowards the more fertile coastal areas along Mediterranean shores.1 While\nfamine and international politics are readily acknowledged as the twin\nprecipitating factors for Hilali migrations and invasions, in contrast many\nepic poets and storytellers of Upper Egypt, who recite the popular cycle of\ntales about the Hilali tribes known throughout the Arabic-speaking worlds\n\nSusan Slyomovics\nas Siμrat Baniμ Hilaμl, present an alternate literary history and reading from\ntraditional chroniclers such as Ibn Khaldun.\nAccording to the performed version by the Upper Egyptian epic poet\n>Awadallah >Abd al-Jalil >Ali, it is a father-daughter tale of incest that\nframes, indeed instigates, the occasion of the Hilali invasion of North\nAfrica. The incest theme is enshrined in the opening sequence of Part II of\nthe customary tripartite division of Siμrat Baniμ Hilaμl entitled the riyada or\n\"reconnaissance,\" even as it is enunciated in the opening tale's subtitle as\ngiven by the poet >Awadallah: \"The Passion of Ma>bad for His Daughter\"\n(>as ig ma>bad ma> bintuh).\n>Awad\\allah >Abd al-Jaliμl >Ali is an epic poet from the province of\nAswan in Upper Egypt. He sings in the surrounding southern\nEgyptian marketplaces, in cafes, during public ceremonies, and at\npeople's homes to celebrate births, weddings, circumcisions, a\nreturn from the hajj to Mecca, and Ramadan break fasts. I have\ndescribed elsewhere the complex status of the epic poet in southern\nEgypt as well as my research project to record versions of the epic\nby professional reciters.2 >Awadallah begins his \"elicited\" performance,\nrecorded 13 March 1983 in Luxor, Egypt,3 first with the title, then with a\nbrief praise-poem or madiμh\\ (lines 1-2):\n\nSusan Slyomovics\n1. yaμ >eμniμ -is\\s\\abr awlaμli4\nPatience is foremost [first]\n2. -is\\\\s\\\\abr awla min ilgalagaμn\nPatience is more important than worry\nThe tale continues as he recounts how the ruler of Tunis, Sultan\nMa>bad, chances to ascend the upper levels of his vast palace there to\nencounter, presumably for the first time, his grown-up and now beautiful\ndaughter, >Aziμza. Overcome at the sight of her, Ma>bad falls to the ground\nin a swoon causing his daughter to gather him up in her arms (lines 3-33):\n3. ma>bad jaμlis >ala -lkaraμsi\nMa>bad is seated on his

using phrases well known to amorous Upper Egyptian partners\n(lines 46-54): \"when are lovers to be blamed.\"7 Love conquers all,\naccording to the sultan, even permitting him the authority to marry, rather\nthan marry off, his own daughter:\n46. gaμl ya >aziμza xallini fi h\\aμli\nHe said, \"O >Aziμza, let me be,\n47. mettaμ >a-l>as agiμn malaμm\nwhen are lovers to be blamed,\n48. ya bit ana >as

you,\n54. w-ajri >aleμki li-sunna h\\alaμl\nand proceed with you according to lawful custom.\"\nComparing ownership of his daughter 's body to his stewardship over the\nland, he demands his rightful sexual rights equating them to agricultural\nbounty. \"Who is like your father?\" he demands of his daughter, reversing\nthe kin relation most socially taboo, to promote the closest member.\nThough the preferred marriage partner in Upper Egyptian society for a\ndaughter is in the first cousin line, especially the father's brother's son,\nMac>bad's questions to his daughter are disconcertingly direct and sexual to\nan Upper Egyptian listener: \"peaches\" and \"pomegranates\" to be harvested\nare common similes for a women's breasts, the \"orchard\" to be \"entered\"\nstands for penetrating the female genitals and \"to rule and trace the\nriverbeds\" describe the interior fold of the vagina and sexual intercourse.8\n\nSusan Slyomovics\n55. ya bit miμn zayy abuμki\n\"O daughter, who is

marry your father\n62. wi-ti>Iμs iμ fiμ hanaμ wa-<amaμn\nand you will live in joy and safety.\"\n\nSusan Slyomovics\n>Aziμza protests marriage with her father and calls for supporting legal\nprotections, the Muslim shar>ia that regulates and ordains lawful unions as\ninterpreted by clerics:\n63. ya -buya <ismallah >aleμk\n\"O, my father, may God protect you,\n64. yak >aglak

>Aziμza,\n70. <aktib >alayy bi-sunna h\\alaμl\nthen write me a marriage contract according to lawful custom.\"\n\nSusan Slyomovics\nMa>bad convenes his clerics and presents them with a series of\nquestions. As Otto Rank observes in his study, Incest in Literature and\nLegend,9 it is noteworthy that cross-culturally an element of the father-\ndaughter incest theme often includes riddles posed by the father to suitors.\nMa>bad's questions to the clerics are prefigured in the rhetorical series\nalready asked to his daughter, ostensible riddles whose meanings are fully\nunderstood by >Aziμza. The father's purpose, avers Otto Rank, is to set up\nimpossible tasks by asking riddles thereby keeping rivals and suitable love\nobjects from the daughter and permitting the father to possess his own\ndaughter. Rank draws on numerous medieval European tales, ancient Greek,\nBabylonian and Persian legends, to compare the ways in which suitors must\nsolve impossible riddles or, functionally another substitutable narrative\nelement for a riddle, suitors must overcome dangerous obstacles set by the\nfather before the daughter is awarded to the winner. In these cases, the\ndaughter is an important love object but otherwise she is absent during the\nimportant exchanges between the father, her current owner, and a future\nowner-husband.\nIn >Awadallah's rendition, the Muslim clerics precede, perhaps stand\nin for potential suitors, because they represent the surrounding religious and\nsocial sanctions. Ma>bad's riddles are equally transparent to them and even\n\nSusan Slyomovics\nthough they are in need of more food and clothing as the month long\nRamadan approaches, not even material concerns can buy the clerics\nacquiescence to Ma>bad's requested transgression:\n71. ma>bad tawwir munaμdi\nMa>bad sent around a crier\n72. >ala ahl il-ulama fi kull I bakan\nto scholars every place.\n73. firh\\it ilulama jami>an\nThe scholars all rejoiced,\n74. ilmifattah\\ gaμd il>amiyaμn\nthe sighted lead the blind.\n75. illi yiguμl raμh\\ yiksiμna\nSome say he will clothe us,\n76. >aleμna daxil >Iμd ramad\\an\nfor Ramadan is soon upon us,\n77. w-illi yiguμl hayigata> ru<usna\nand others say he will cut off our heads\n78. taji -lxsara >a -l>amyaμn\nhe will come to cut off the blind.\n79. itlammu juwwa -ddawawiμn\n\nSusan Slyomovics\nThey gathered inside the diwans,\n80. fiμ diwaμn ma>bad issult\\aμn\nin the diwan of Ma>bad the sultan.\n81. nadah\\ wi-gaμl ya ulamaμ\nHe called out and said, \"O clerics,\n82. >aleμkum wila <agati kalaμm\nto you I do not conceal my words:\n83. >andiyya tamra fi -lbeμt, tamar\nI have a date tree at my home,\n84. t\\arah\\it min giμr >awaμm\nit became ripe out of season,\n85. yis\\ah\\h\\ nakuμlha\nis it permissible to eat it\n86. wila nizakiμha >a -laytaμm\nor give it as charity to orphans?\"\n87. rayiμs ilulamaμ yiguμllu\nThe chief cleric said to him:\n88. ilkaμn hiyya tamra\nIf indeed it is a date tree,\"\n89. yigullu akl ittamra h\\alaμl\n\nSusan Slyomovics\nhe said to him, \" eating dates is permissible,\n90. wi-za kaμn izzeμna >aziμza\nbut if it is the beauteous >Aziμza\n91. yibga h\\araμm ya sultaμn\nit will be a crime, O sultan.\"\n92. Ma>bad sah\\ab isseμf\nMa>bad wielded his sword\n93. >aleμhum walad ilyat\\agan\nagainst them, he brough forth the javelin,\n94. Ma>bad sah\\ab isseμf\nMa>bad wielded his sword.\n95. t\\il>uμ ramh\\iμn bi -lmis waμr\nThey emerged fleeing this commission,\n96. il>ulama t\\il>uμ ramh\\iμn\nthe clerics emerged fleeing,\n97. ilmifattah\\ s\\ah\\h\\ il>amyaμn\nthe sighted dragging the blind.\nSince Ma>bad, the sultan, cannot possess his own daughter according to law\nor her own consent, as her father and ruler of Tunis, he swears that he will\n\nSusan Slyomovics\nprevent any other man from having her. Otto Rank notes that in the myths\nof Perseus, Gilgamesh and Romulus, the father secludes the daughter\npresumably to preserve her virginity. Frequently, the father's persecution of\nhis daughter arising from rejected love takes the symbolic form of her\nisolation in a tower:10\n98. ma>bad xalaf bi yimiμn\nMa>bad swore an oath:\n99. ana min t\\uμl h\\ayy >a -ddunya\nAs for me, during my entire life in this world,\n100. >aziμza ma titjawwiz rijaμl\n>Aziμza will not marry men.\"\n101. ma>bad nadam il banayiμn\nMa>bad summoned builders,\n102. juμ-lu h\\afyin min ard\\ is s aμm\nthey came to him, shoeless, from Syrian lands,\n103. yindah >a -t\\t\\awabiμn\nhe summoned brickmakers\n104. >as ra ts ara> fi -lbinyaμn\nten to lay out the building,\n\nSusan Slyomovics\n105. ilmuhandisiμn s ayy katiμr\nengineers, so many of them,\n106. s arah\\ ilgas\\r abuμ -l>umdaμn\nthey laid out the many-pillared castle,\n107. s arah\\ gas\\r >aziμza\nthey laid out >Aziμza's castle.\n108. h\\alaf wi-watag ilaymaμn\nHe swore msking stronger his oaths:\n109. min t\\uμl h\\ayy >ala -ddunya\n\"For my entire life on this earth\n110. >aziμza ma dugg rijaμl\n>Aziμza will not taste a man.\"\nAziza is immured in her castle with a maidservant, Mayy, who will serve as\nthe link between Tunis and Arabia. It happens that Mayy is a Hilali Bedouin\nwho appears in the slavemarkets of Tunis. She has been purchased by the\nsultan to care for >Aziμza, and she whiles away time amusing the miserable\nand bored >Aziμza by recounting tales of her Arabian home and its mighty\nwarriors. Through narrative and storytelling, >Aziμza falls in love with\nYuμnis, the hero Abu Zayd's nephew. The two women contrive to send\nmessages back to the Hilalis in Arabia to inform them that Tunis is weak\n\nSusan Slyomovics\nand easily invaded. The daughter's revenge against the father is powerful,\npersonal, and political. Ma>bad the sultan will lose possession of his\ndaughter just as he will be toppled as ruler. In both instances, his nemesis\nare the Hilali Bedouins.\nWhat does this performed tale mean to the audience, to the\nstoryteller, and to the folklorist collector? During the performance, S\\a>Iμd\\iμ\nlisteners clucked their tongues disapprovingly as the narrative unfolded.\nDuring discussions after the performance, most listeners denied that any\ninstance of father-daughter incest had ever occurred in >Awadallah's village\nof Najis al-Haj>. In our private conversations, >Awadallah remembered\nspecific village examples and recounted one flagrant case of a daughter\nimpregnated by her father whose child was adopted by her family as her\nsister at the same time as the sinning father was banished from the village.\nWhile these contested and often repressed village histories may or may not\nsupport actual cases of known incest in Upper Egypt, what is emphasized in\nmy analysis is the fantasy and the fantastic dimensions of folklore in\ngeneral, and of popular transmitted folk epic in particular.\nAccording to Otto Rank, the fantasy creations and substitutes\nemerging from the father-daughter incest complex are always presented\nfrom the father's perspective, not the daughter's. Rank larger claims are that\n\nSusan Slyomovics\n\"artistic activity is intended to gratify and justify male sexual fantasies.\"11\nComparing father-daughter incest with psychiatry's assertion of the more\nserious infraction of mother-son incest, Rank notes a diminished degree in\nkinship between father and daughter and no serious age difference to\nimpede the realization by males (e.g. fathers) of their violent and satisfying\nexpression of fantasies. The father-daughter incest theme in this Upper\nEgyptian epic shares elements that correspond to many of Rank's\ncharacterizations, but at one extreme. The incest is conscious and must be\nconsciously foiled. Therefore it cannot be contained within the family\ncontext, instead this instance of father-daughter incest is resolved within\nvast social and political frameworks: extreme political upheaval will ensue\ncompletely reorganizing for centuries to come the geography, boundaries,\neven the ethnic and religious composition of North Africa. An historical\ncatastrophe for a region, in Ibn Khalduμn's words meriting a description of\n\"locusts descending,\" can only have as its motivating source, according to\nUpper Egyptian epic singers, the wrath, incest fear, and ultimately, the\nrealized passion of a woman who cannot be thwarted.\n\nSusan Slyomovics\n\n1 For viewpoints on the geographical and political causes of Hilali\nmovements westward, see Ibn Khalduμn, Kitab al->ibaμr wa diμwaμn al-\nmubtada< wa-al-khabar, trans.
