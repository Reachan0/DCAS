These wastes, most significantly from\nuranium mining, may be generated in large volumes and stored on land near the mine\nsite. The waste rock and soil has little or no practical use. Uranium mine wastes from\nmines that closed before about 1975 are of particular concern. In many cases, these\nmines remain unreclaimed today, with the wastes piled near the mine as it was when the\nmine closed. Below is information about wastes from several resource extraction\nindustries:\n-\nUranium\n-\nFertilizer\nProduction\n-\nAluminum\n-\nCopper Waste\nRock\n-\nGold and Silver\n-\nRare Earths\n-\nTitanium Ores\n-\nZircon\n\nUranium\nThe mining of uranium ores by underground, by in-situ leaching, and by surface\nmethods produces large and small amounts of bulk waste material, including excavated\ntop soil, overburden that contains no ore, weakly uranium-enriched waste rock, and\nsubgrade ores, and evaporation pond sludges and scales. These materials typically\ncontain radionuclides of radium, uranium, and thorium.\nMaterials\nRadiation Level\n[pCi/g]\n\nlow average high\n\nUranium Mining\nOverburden\n\nlow\n\nUranium In-Situ\nLeachate\nEvaporation Pond\nlow\nhundreds\n\nSolids\n\nFertilizer Production\nThe production of phosphates for fertilizer generates wastes in very large volumes that\nare stored in huge piles called \"stacks\" that cover hundreds of acres in Florida and other\nphosphate-processing states. These radioactive materials contain radium and other\nradionuclides and create large amounts of radon. EPA and state agencies have\nregulations controlling these wastes. In addition, the state of Florida has created an\nindependent state research agency charged with investigating ways to minimize adverse\nenvironmental impacts of the phosphate industry.\nMaterials\nRadiation Level\n[pCi/g]\n\nlow average\nhigh\n\nPhosphate Ore\n(Florida)\n17.3-39.5 6.2-\n53.5\n\nPhosphogypsum\n7.3 11.7-24.5 36.7\n\nPhosphate\nFertilizer\n\n0.5 5.7\n\nAluminum\nWaste muds created by the extraction of alumina from its ore, bauxite, may contain low\nlevels of radioactivity, usually from uranium, thorium, radium, and their radioactive\ndecay products\nMaterials\nRadiation Level\n[pCi/g]\n\nlow average\nhigh\n\nOre (Bauxite)\n4.4 NA\n7.4\n\nProduct\n\n0.23\n\nProduction\nWastes\nNA 3.9-5.6\nNA\n\nCopper Waste Rock\nMining and extraction of copper by common surface or underground methods can\nconcentrate or expose uranium, thorium, and radium in waste rock. Another extraction\nmethod, known as \"in-situ\" leaching, can transport uranium and thorium into\ngroundwater or surface water at the site. In this method, rather than removing soil and\nrock to reach the copper deposit, liquids containing chemicals are allowed to seep\nthrough copper-bearing rocks and dissolve the copper. It also dissolves radionuclides\nthat may be in the soil and rock. The liquids are captured and the copper is recovered,\nleaving the radionuclides. Some of the liquids remain and may contaminate water in the\narea. In-situ leaching may also be used on tailings (waste rock).\nWastes\nRadiation Level\n[pCi/g]\n\nlow average\nhigh\n\nCopper Waste\nRock\n0.7 12\n82.6\n\nGold and Silver\nWhile few studies have been done on these ores, some western mines produced uranium\nas a secondary product when extracting precious metals. Pitchblende (a naturally\noccurring material containing low concentrations of uranium) has been found in the\nsame ores as gold and silver. Waste rock from some of these mines may be radioactive.\nRare Earths\nRare earths are a group of elements that have electrical properties that make them useful\nin electronics and electrical applications. Lanthanides and yttrium are recovered\nprimarily from ores and minerals that naturally contain uranium and thorium. As a\nresult, the waste rock and sludges from the extraction of rare earths also contain these\nradionuclides.\nMaterials\nRadiation Level\n[pCi/g]\n\nlow average high\n\nRare\nEarths(Monazite,\nXenotime,\nBastnasite)\n5.7\n\nTitanium Ores\nUranium, thorium, and radium commonly occur in titanium ore and monazite occurs in\nsands from which the titanium is extracted. As a result, the mineral sludges, dusts, and\nsands from the extraction process may be radioactive.\nMaterials\nRadiation Level\n[pCi/g]\n\nlow average\nhigh\n\nTitanium Ores\n\n8.0\n24.5\n\nRutile\n3.9 19.7\nNA\n\nIlmenite\nNA 5.7\n\nWastes\n3.9 12\n\nZircon\nZircon is naturally radioactive, containing small amounts of uranium, thorium and\nradium in its crystalline structure. It is also mined from deposits containing other\nradioactive minerals such as monazite.\nMaterials\nRadiation Level\n[pCi/g]\n\nlow average\nhigh\n\nZircon\n\nWastes\n\n]\nEnergy Production Wastes\n-\nCoal and Coal Ash\n-\nGeothermal Energy Waste Scales\n\n-\nPetroleum (oil and gas)\nCoal and Coal Ash\nCoal contains trace quantities of the naturally occurring radionuclides of uranium,\nthorium, and potassium as well as their radioactive decay products. When coal is burned,\nminerals including most of the radionuclides do not burn and as a result are concentrated\nin the ash.\nWastes\nRadiation Level\n[pCi/g]\n\nlow average\nhigh\n\nBottom Ash\n1.6 3.5-4.6\n7.7\n\nFly Ash\n5.8\n9.7\n\nGeothermal Energy Waste Scales\nUsing geothermal energy, requires drilling deep holes (boreholes) and inserting pipes for\npumping high-temperature fluids from the ground. The rocks that contain the high-\ntemperature fluids may also contain minerals, which tend to form a scale inside the pipes\nand production equipment. If the rocks also contain radionuclides, such as radium, the\nmineral scale, production sludges, and waste water will contain TENORM.\nWastes\nRadiation Level\n[pCi/g]\n\nlow average\nhigh\n\nGeothermal\nEnergy Waste\nScales\n10 132\n\nPetroleum (Oil and Gas)\nThe rocks that contain oil and gas deposits often contain water as well. The water will\ndissolve minerals and radionuclides, such as radium, that are in the rocks. As a result,\nradium and its radioactive decay products become concentrated in production wastes.\nWastes include: pipe scale that tends to form inside oil and gas production pipes and\nequipment, large volumes of waste water, and sludges that accumulate in tanks or pits.\n\nWastes\nRadiation Level [pCi/g]\n\nlow average high\n\nProduced\nWater [pCi/l]\n0.1\nNA\n9,000\n\nPipe/Tank\nScale\n<0.25 <200\n>100,000\n\nWater and Waste Treatment Residues\nWater Treatment\nSince water comes from streams, lakes, reservoirs and aquifers, it contains varying\nlevels of naturally occurring radioactivity derived from surrounding rocks and\nsediments. Wastes from municipal water treatment plants receiving this water may\nconcentrate some amounts of this radioactivity, even if the treatment systems were not\noriginally designed to remove it.\nWastes\nRadiation Level\n[pCi/g]\n\nlow average\nhigh\n\nTreatment Sludge\n[pCi/l]\n1.3 11\n11,686\n\nTreatment Plant\nFilters\n\n40,000\n\nConsumer Products Containing TENORM\nSome TENORM may be found in certain consumer products. For example, zircon\ncontains minute quantities of uranium and thorium, and is widely used as a glaze for\nceramics and metal molds.\nThe EPA and others working on the problem have identified many sources of\nTENORM. Identifying sources and determining the potential risks from them remains a\najor focus of our work.\nm"

ILA\nNatural & Geological Environment\nFor a long time, the understanding was that\nthe relationship between the inner parts of the\nlithosphere and the biosphere is only mono-\ndirectional, i.e., one -way. But the reverse is\nalso true is the current understanding.\nMagmatism and metamorphism:\nFormations of rocks, volcanic exhalations,\nrock folding, mountain formation and such\nprocesses influence the processes like\nweathering, sediment formation, ground water\nactivity.\nPage 45 Komatina.\n\nJanuary 9, 2006: IAP 2006: 12.091\nSession 1: P. ILA\nNatural & Geological Environment ...\nA quarter century worth research effort clearly\nindicates that the reverse influence, namely,\nthe external processes effect the internal\nprocesses. For example, processes happening\nin the biosphere effect the composition of\nhydrothermal solutions, sedimentary formation\nof sulphur.\n\"Thus, there is unity of the lithosphere as a\ncomplex dynamic system with feed back from\nthe biosphere.\" - M.

ILA\nGeological Environment\nIgneous rocks:\nRocks formed by the cooling and solidification of hot\nmolten magma. Magma is a material formed by\nlocalized melting within the Earth.\nIntrusive igneous rocks are formed by If the\nmagma solidification beneath the Earth's surface.\nExample: Granite.\nExtrusive igneous or volcanic rocks are formed\nby the solidification of magma above Earth's surface\nin the form of lava. Example: Basalt.\n\nJanuary 9, 2006: IAP 2006: 12.091\nSession 1: P. ILA\nGeological Environment ...\nSedimentary rocks are formed at the Earth's\nsurface:\nClastic sedimentary rocks from the weathered and\neroded fragments of pre-existing rocks -\nexample: quartz sandstone;\nOrganic sedimentary rocks from the hard parts of\nanimals or plants - example: shelly limestone, coal;\nChemical sedimentary rocks from the precipitation\nout of solution of dissolved minerals - example: rock\nsalt, gypsum.\n\nJanuary 9, 2006: IAP 2006: 12.091\nSession 1: P. ILA\nGeological Environment ...\nThe color/composition of the rock is, at its\nsimplest, divided into\nMafic: dark colored rocks\nIntermediate colored rocks.\nFelsic: light colored rocks.\nUltramafic: Some characteristics of mafic, but\nlack some others. Example: Dunite, Peridotite\n\nJanuary 9, 2006: IAP 2006: 12.091\nSession 1: P. ILA\nMetamorphic rocks are formed from the mineralogical\nand/or textural transformation, in the solid state, of\npre-existing rocks due to the action of temperature\nand/or pressure.\nMetamorphic rocks that have been subjected\n(1) to deep burial typically display a foliated texture\ndue to the parallel alignment of some constituent\nminerals - example:schist;\n(2) to the segregation of minerals into separate\nbands of different composition, example: gneiss\nGeological Environment\n\nJanuary 9, 2006: IAP 2006: 12.091\nSession 1: P.

Williams explained excellently, in his article \"Uptake\nof elements form a chemical point of view\":\nthe influence of primitive sea on the chemical elements of\nchemical system, which in turn effected the primitive life,\n\nthe free elements of the primitive sea self generated a\nchemical system of interactions that could be seen in\ncytoplasm of all cells even in today,\nthe evolution of the free and bound the metallomes and\nmetabollomes was largely due to the formation of large\ncompartments, and in oxidative possibilities\nChange of oxidation states of elements with increased oxygen with time\nNote: Metallome, coined by R.J.P. Williams, means distribution of free metal ions in every one of cellular compartments.\nMetabollome (or metabolome) means the entire set of metabolic entities and small network pathways in a cell, tissue, organ,\norganisms, and species.\nRef.

The cosmic radiation interacts\nwith the upper atmosphere, and produces\ncosmogenic radioactive nuclides. They\ncan have long half-lives, but the majority\nhave shorter half-lives than the primordial\nnuclides.\n\nJanuary 11, 2006: IAP 2006, 12.091\nSession 2A: P.

Picocuries are a measurement of radiation. While no level of radiation\nis considered safe, the EPA has established an action level of 4 picocuries per liter. This guideline takes into account both health risks and\ncurrent technology. In most homes, radon levels can reliably be reduced to this level and often even lower.\nThe higher the radon level in your home, the more urgent it is to take corrective action to lower the levels and avoid unnecessary health risks.\nCourtesy of Environmental Protection Agency, USA\n\nJanuary 11, 2006: IAP 2006: 12.091 Session 2B:\nP.

ILA\nRadon and RDP Sampling Methods\n\nTime integrated (single average)\nDevices that measure a single average of the exposure are time integrating detectors.\nThese can be active (power operated) or passive (no electrical power needed). Passive\nintegrating devices are low cost and simple to operate.\nEx: Activated charcoal canisters and alpha track detectors.\n\nContinuous ( time dependent variation)\nContinuous sampling measures the variation of radon and RDP levels over a period of\ntime such as half hourly, hourly or 4 hourly over a period of time.\nEx: Alpha scintillation, Pulse Ion Chamber, Silicon Surface Detector\n\nGrab sampling ( brief sampling)\nThis measurement involves collection of representative air sample over a short period\nof time such as 5 minutes. It is essentially an instantaneous measurement indicative of\nthe concentration level at the time of measurement for diagnostic purpose only.\nMeasurements are interpreted as relative indicators.\nEx: Continuous monitor\n\nSniffing ((for diagnostic purpose only)\nSame as grab sampling, but even faster to provide information for pre or post\nmitigation. Diagnostics to locate suspected radon entry routes.\n\nJanuary 11, 2006: IAP 2006:\n12.091 Session 2B: P. ILA\nRadon Monitors\nCharcoal detectors\nCharcoal detectors use activated carbon to adsorb radon gas by molecular\ndiffusion in the grains, where it decays into the short-lived RDPs. At the end of\nthe measurement period the detector is sent to a laboratory to measure the\ngamma activity against a calibrated source.\nAlpha track detectors\nAlpha track detectors Typically consist of a small alpha sensitive plastic chip or\ncellulose film. Record the alpha tracks from radon and RDPs from radon that\ndiffuses through filter.The density of the tracks is proportional to the radon concentration.\nElectret ion chambers\nElectret ion chambers detect ions produced by the decay of radon and RDPs.\nRadon diffuses into the chamber through filter. Radon decays to RDPs, and RDPs\ncontinue to decay, all emitting alphas, betas and gamma rays. This radiation\ncauses ionization which is proportional to the radon concentration.\n\nJanuary 11, 2006: IAP 2006:\n12.091 Session 2B: P. ILA\nContinuous Radon Monitors\n\nA continuous radon monitor (CRM) is an electronic device\nthat measures the variation in radon levels over time.\nContinuous radon monitor collects the radon by either pump\n(active) or diffusion (passive). RDPs are filtered out. Alpha\nparticles from radon and its RDPs are counted.\n\nCRMs are typically three types -\nAlpha scintillation,\nPulse ion chamber,\nSilicon surface barrier.\n\nWeb-Based &Networked Continuous Radon Monitoring in\nReal Time with High Sensitivity\nRef: CRPA Bulletin Vol. 23 (2002) 9-11\n\nJanuary 11, 2006: IAP 2006: 12.091 Session 2B:\nP.

Most often, it is assumed that HVAC systems reduce indoor radon concentrations. In this slide, the usual assumption is wrong.\nThis day care center, in a public school, contained a nursery where about 6 children less than 1 year of age slept. Note that the weekend, unoccupied\nperiod had lower radon concentrations than the occupied period. The weekday peaks occurred on most days at around noontime. I believe that\nthe operation of kitchen rangetop ventilators in an adjacent wing are likely suspects in this mystery.\nCourtesy of Environmental Protection Agency, USA\n\nJanuary 11, 2006: IAP 2006: 12.091\nJanuary 11, 2006: IAP 2006: 12.091\nSession 2B: P.

This report goes on to refine the\nrisks of radon in drinking water and confirms that there are\ndrinking water related cancer deaths, primarily due to lung\ncancer.

      "content": "CHLORINE & ITS CONSEQUENCES\n\nReport By: Jacqueline Brazin\n\n12.091 Medical Geology/Geochemistry\n\nDr. P. Ila\n\nIAP 2006, 01/30/2006\n\nINTRODUCTION\nChlorine and its consequences have a far more reaching effect in society that one\nmay have imagined. Consider a soccer ball, powerade (sport drink), the human body, the\nocean, table salt, and a bleach pen. What do all these items have in common? They are\nall composed of some form of chlorine. Chlorine is all-around us and can be found in\nvarious forms as evident by these few examples. G.E. Porter, Nobel laureate in chemistry\nsaid, \"So it comes about that salt, sodium chloride, formed from these violently reactive\nand poisonous elements, is not only safe to eat, it is essential to life. And the element\nchlorine, seeking another electron wherever it can be found, . . . is a destroyer of life and\na useful bacteria\" [Ref. 8]. The increased prevalence of chlorine in our society cannot be\nreversed at this time. Therefore, it is important to understand how it will continue to\nimpact our lives. This paper reviews critical aspects of chlorine, chloride and its\ncompounds and the role it plays in the world.\nChloride\nChloride Function\nThe word chlorine comes from the Greek word khloros, which means greenish-\nyellow. Chlorine is element 17 on the periodic table and exists as a chloride ion (Cl-) and\nas chlorine (Cl2). The element chlorine is in Group VII on the periodic table and\nclassified as a halogen because it is highly reactive, and therefore, can not exist as a\nmonatomic molecule. Chloride and chlorine are not produced the same way and do not\nhave the same effects on the human body. Chloride (Cl-) is found in the form of salts\nsuch as NaCl and KCl. It maintains the electrical balance in the nervous system and is\ninvolved in intracellular and extracellular transport. Chlorine (Cl2), on the other hand,\n\nexists only in the form of a diatomic molecule. It is a product of the electrolysis reaction:\n2NaCl + 2H2O Æ 2NaOH + Cl2 + H2.\n\"Life evolved from water\" [Ref. 1]. The ocean holds all of the chloride that we\nneed. Chloride is formed as a byproduct of the electrolytes, K, Mg, and Na. \"In its\noriginal form, chloride is formed from various rocks into soil and water by years of\nweathering process\" [Ref. 3]. From there, it is transported to oceans or closed basins.\nChloride is also found in the stomach as HCl, where it maintains the pH. Chloride is very\nimportant for human metabolic processes. \"To function properly, organisms must\nactively pump sodium and chloride out of cells and actively take in potassium.\" [Ref. 1].\nThe biological functions of sodium, potassium, and chloride include controlling cellular\nproperties such as osmotic pressure, membrane potentials, condensation of\npolyelectrolytes, and required ionic strength for activity [Ref. 1].\nChloride is also an essential mineral [Ref. 4]. \"Chloride is the major extracellular\nanion maintained at a concentration of 100-110 mmol L-1 in that fluid.\" [Ref. 1]. \"Like\nNa+, there is no control over Cl- absorption, and homeostasis is affected by renal\nreabsorption\" [Ref. 1]. It represents 70% of the body's total negative ion content [Ref. 3].\nThe suggested amount of chloride intake is 750-900 mg/day [Ref. 3] As a main\nelectrolyte in the body, it assists in conduction of electrical impulses. Chlorine is an\nelectrolyte and a minor element making up 0.14% of the concentration of elements in the\nhuman body [Ref. 3, 4]. Another role of chloride in the body is to combine with\nhydrogen to form HCl, which breaks down proteins for absorption of other metallic\nminerals. It also maintains the electrical neutrality across the stomach membrane. With\nNa and K, chloride works well to keep all of our biological systems running smoothly.\n\nChloride associated diseases\nLike every essential mineral, diseases can result if there is an abundant or\ndeficient intake. Usually, diseases associated with chloride intake are rare. Chloride\ntoxicity has not been observed in humans except for impaired NaCl metabolism [Ref. 3]\nThis can be avoided by a healthy diet and an active lifestyle. Deficiency diseases are also\nrare, but alkalosis can occur if the blood becomes overly alkaline. It results from excess\nloss of sodium and is a life threatening condition. Some symptoms include loss of\nappetite, lethargy, and muscle weakness [Ref. 6]. Hypochloremia is another condition\nwhich occurs due to a deficiency of chloride. Symptoms can include water overload,\nwasting conditions, and heavy sweating [Ref. 7].\nChlorine\nHistory of Chlorine\nThe history of chlorine is quite fascinating because it dates back to the beginning\nof American history. The Swedish chemist, Karl Wilhelm Scheele, discovered chlorine\nin 1774. For over two centuries, it has been used for many applications in advancing\ndifferent scientific fields ranging from the disinfecting the water supply to developing\nimproved medications. In 1826, silver chloride was used to produce images marking the\nfirst photography, and in 1847, chloroform was first used as an anesthetic. It was later\nfound to be harmful to patient, and other anesthetics were used instead. In 1908, the\nJersey City waterworks used chlorine to disinfect the water supply. As a result of the\nsuccess of that program, the Department of Treasury called for all water to be disinfected\nwith chlorine by 1918. This was one of the greatest applications of chlorine because\ndrinking contaminated water was a major cause of death in the early twentieth century.\n\nIn 1912, polyvinylchloride (PVC) was invented without a purpose. B.F. Goodrich later\nmarketed it and sold it as a shower curtain. In 1915, chlorine was first used as a weapon\nin World War I, and in 1922, chlorine was used as liquid bleach for the household. In\n1933, Dow Chemical produced Saran (polyvinylidene chloride), and in 1949 it was\nmarketed as Saran wrap. Throughout the 1990's, various forms of chlorine have been\nused for medicines and developing medical imaging techniques such as x-rays and\nsimilar devices. Today, chlorine can be found in bleach products used for laundry or in\nthe individual household for cleaning purposes. It can be found in swimming pools and\nin the drinking water supply.\nFacts about Chlorine\nChlorine is involved in many aspects of the world. Every year, 12 million tons\nare produced in North America [Ref. 9]. Economically, chlorine is very important. It\nsupports 2 million jobs annually in the US [Ref. 9]. Chlorine makes up 25% of the yearly\noutput of plastics. It is also used for medical products, packaging, and\nappliances/electronics. Chlorine is not replaceable in these products, and to date, there is\nno known alternative.\nChlorine isotopes\nThere are nine isotopes of chlorine, but only three are stable including 35Cl, 36Cl,\nand 37Cl. 36Cl is radioactive and can be used as a tracer to label compounds. Its half-life\nis 3.01 x 105 years. The molecular weight of chlorine is 35.45 g/mol because 35Cl is the\nmost abundant isotope making up 75.77% of chlorine's weight.\nRoutes of Exposure\n\nExposure to chlorine can occur via three routes: inhalation, ingestion, and dermal\ncontact. Inhalation is likely to occur as a result of an occupational exposure. For\nexample, this can be a problem for workers who oversee operations or handle chemicals\ninvolving the polymerization process of PVC. Ingestion can happen if the drinking water\nsupply is contaminated from chlorine waste products because it is improperly discarded\nthere. Chlorinated byproducts of chemical reactions at nearby plants can also penetrate\nthe soil and get into the water. Dermal contact can happen when handling a polymer\nsuch as PVC during the polymerization process. It is extremely important to take proper\nsafety precautions when working with chlorine or any of its related compounds. Harmful\neffects due to exposure to chlorine or its related compounds depend on the dose and the\nroutes of exposure. Inhalation of chlorine irritates the respiratory system. At 3.5 ppm,\nthe odor can be detected, and at 1000 ppm, inhalation can be fatal. The workplace\nregulations established by National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH)\nset the recommended exposure limit for chlorine to be less than 0.5 ppm, which is much\nlower than the amount at which it can be detected [Ref. 10]. Pulmonary edema can result\nfrom this exposure and the lungs may become more susceptible to other diseases such as\ncarcinoma.\nChlorine Compounds\n\nThere are many different chlorine compounds. Some have aromatic rings with\nchlorine(s) as a side group. Chlorine compounds can also form as a result of byproducts\nfrom chemical reactions. \"Adding chlorine to organic matter almost invariably increases\none or more hazardous properties--persistence, toxicity or the tendency to\n\nbioaccumulate. . .these chemicals dominate virtually all government lists of priority\npollutants\" [Ref. 8]. Below is a discussion of several of these chlorinated compounds.\n\nDioxin (Polychlorinated Dibenzo Furans (PCDF) and Polychlorinated Dibenzo\nDioxins (PCDD)) is a chlorinated organic compound. It is a byproduct of vinyl chloride\nmanufacture and can be produced from trash barrels, coal fired utilities, wood burning,\nmetal smelting, and diesel trucks. \"Dioxins do not break down to any appreciable degree\nin the environment; virtually all the tetrachlorodi-benzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) released in the\nenvironment will remain there...indefinitely\" [Ref. 8]. The National Toxicology Program\nhas classified dioxin as a known human carcinogen [Ref. 11]. It bioaccumulates in\ntissues because as an organochlorine it is more soluble in oil and fats than they are in\nwater. Exposure can cause chloracne, diabetes, and cancer, which has been shown in\nlaboratory animals.\nPolyvinyl chloride production is also a hazardous process, and the workers have a\nhigh risk of an occupational exposure if they do not take the proper safety precautions.\n\"In the late 1960s, Dr. John Creech and Dr. Maurice Johnson were the first to clearly link\nand recognize the carcinogenicity of vinyl chloride monomer to humans when workers in\nthe polyvinyl chloride polymerization section of a B.F. Goodrich plant near Louisville,\nKentucky, were diagnosed with liver angiosarcoma, a rare disease\" [Ref. 12]. Vinyl\nchloride is a human carcinogen as shown by the International Agency for Research on\nCancer [Ref. 13].\nAnother chlorinated compound is chloroform, a volatile chemical which can be\nfound in any chemistry laboratory. At 990 ppm, exposure can result in dizziness and\nfatigue, and the vapors can depress the central nervous system. Liver and kidney damage\n\ncan occur at higher inhalation levels. NIOSH considers it to be a potential human\ncarcinogen [Ref. 13].\nExposure to all these chemicals should be limited. If they are used, it is extremely\nvital to ensure that all safety precautions are taken. Additionally, chlorinated chemicals\nthat are byproducts of reactions should be monitored daily to prevent any excess from\nbeing produced unnecessarily.\nSummary\n\nChloride is essential for human metabolism and maintaining electrical neutrality\nin the body. It is most common in the salt form of NaCl. Chlorine is helpful and harmful\nto society. It is a dangerous gas that has high reactivity, and therefore cannot exist in just\nelement form. Chlorine needs to be used in a way that poses no health risks. It is\nimportant to follow the exposure limits and wear the proper safety equipment to prevent\nunnecessary inhalation and dermal contact. Many chlorine compounds are also\ncarcinogenic. These should be handled with extra precautions.\n\nPrevention is crucial when handling any chemicals. Pay particular attention to the\nsafety and toxicology reports of all chlorinated chemicals. It is a reasonable argument to\nwant to remove chlorine from society because of the health hazards it poses. However,\n\"elements cannot be banned. Elements simply are\" [Ref. 8].\nConclusions\nImagine life without plastics. With that said, all forms of chlorine are important for\nhumans to live and to facilitate their lifestyles. There are many ongoing research projects\nto determine the health effects of chlorine because it has become such a prevalent\nchemical in society. Many of these studies are conducted by National Toxicology\n\nProgram (NTP) and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) so\nthat precise exposure limits and health effects can be determined.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

      "content": "IODINE\n12.091 Medical Geology/Geochemistry: Element Report\nIAP 2006, 01/30/2006\n\nChristopher Love\nIntroduction\nIf you have ever looked carefully at your commercial container of salt sitting in the\ncupboard, then you have noticed that it is iodized. Have you ever wondered what that means, or\nwhy it is mentioned? The simple answer to these questions is that a form of the element, iodine,\nis added to the salt in order to keep you healthy. More complex is the underlying reason behind\nmany different types of food fortifications: medical geology. According to medical geology,\nhumans are linked with the natural processes of the Earth by requiring certain levels of particular\nelements and compounds to maintain optimal health. Thus, iodine is added to salt in order to\nsupply enough iodine in your diet and satisfy the link between iodine and optimal health. In\norder to understand why iodine is important for humans to consume, I will examine iodine's\nchemical properties, where it occurs naturally, how it interacts in biological processes, its\ngeologic properties, and the implications of this multidisciplinary analysis.\nChemical characteristics\nChemistry identifies iodine according to its chemical properties, such as the ability to\nreact with other substances, physical properties at various temperatures, and color. Iodine---\nchemical symbol 'I'---is the name given to element 53 on the periodic table of elements. It is a\nnonmetallic element that belongs to Group 17/VIIA of the periodic table (the halogen group).\nThe color of iodine in its gaseous state is violet, which gives iodine its name: it comes from the\nGreek word for violet ('iodes') [Atkins and Jones pp 592]. Iodine has many other known\n\nchemical and physical properties: atomic weight is 126.9045 grams, melting point is 113.7 C,\nboiling point is 184.4 C, and atomic radius is 133.3 pm [Atkins and Jones pp 592]. As a solid,\nwhich is its normal form (at 25 C and 1 atm), iodine has a blue-black color and sublimes easily\n[Atkins and Jones pp 592]. When it is dissolved in organic solvents, it produces solutions having\na variety of colors; starch is a common indicator for the presence of iodine in solution by causing\na solution of iodine to change color [Atkins and Jones pp 592]. If iodine touches the skin of a\nperson, lesions can occur; furthermore, iodine vapor is intensely irritating to the eyes and mucus\nmembranes [Atkins and Jones pp 592]. Even though iodine can be harmful if it is carelessly\nhandled, it still has many practical uses: silver iodide is used in photography, and it is combined\nwith alcohol and used as a disinfectant for wounds [Atkins and Jones, pp 592].\nNatural Occurrence\nWhere else does iodine exist outside of table salt? First of all, we encounter iodine in\nnature as iodide ions in brines and as an impurity in Chile saltpeter; Chile is the leading producer\nof iodine in the world (USGS 2). The main natural source of iodine is kelp: 2000 kg of seaweed\nproduce about 1 kg of iodine [Atkins and Jones, pp 592]. In fact, Bernard Courtois is credited\nwith the discovery of iodine when he \"accidentally added concentrated sulfuric to the seaweed\nFucus vesiculosus\" [Fuge, pp 418]. What's important to note is that Iodine is more naturally\nabundant near the sea; this fact will result in a link between iodine's geology and biological\nconsequences later on in the paper. In order to understand the link, I must first explain the\nbiological role of iodine.\nEssentiality of Iodine:\nIodine is an essential trace element, meaning that the human body needs iodine to\nfunction properly. Without enough of it, health problems can occur; with too much of it, toxic\n\neffects can appear. These observations result in a particular range in which iodine should be\nfound in the body. According to Ron Fuge in Essentials of Medical Geology, the daily\nrecommended dietary intake of iodine is estimated to be \"110-130 μg/day for children under the\nage of 1, 90-120 μg/day for children aged 1-10, and 150 μg/day for adults and adolescents, with\nhigher concentrations required during pregnancy and lactation\" [Fuge, pp 426]. Humans need\niodine because of the thyroid gland, which is located in the neck; anatomically, the thyroid gland\nconsists of two lobes connected by a narrow isthmus, and it is composed of functional units\ncalled follicles [Lindh, pp 149]. The main function of the thyroid gland is to synthesize and store\nthyroid hormones: thyroxine (T4) and 3,5,3 -triiodothyronine (T3) [Lindh, pp 150]. Iodine's role\nin the thyroid gland is to provide the raw material for hormone synthesis [Lindh, pp 150]. In fact,\niodine contributes to 65% of T4 molecular size and 59% of T3 molecular size [Lindh, pp 150].\nThyroid hormones are important for \"normal growth and development\"; they control \"the\nmetabolic activity of many tissues through influences on the metabolism of carbohydrates,\nproteins, lipids, vitamins, nucleic acids, and ions\" [Bernal and DeGroot, pp124-125].\nThe amount of iodine in the thyroid is another important indicator of its essentiality;\nnormal adult thyroid weighs 20-25g and contains 8-10mg of iodine [Cherian and Nordberg, pp\n189]. Iodine is selectively concentrated by the thyroid gland in amounts adequate for hormone\nsynthesis. Most ingested iodine is reduced in the gastrointestinal tract and absorbed almost\ncompletely; the remaining iodine is excreted in the urine [Lindh, pp 150]. Deiodinases help to\nrecycle iodine within the thyroid gland [Gershengor, pp 99]. Thyroid-stimulating hormone\n(TSH) is the major regulator of thyroid function [Cunnane, pp 119]. In response to\nconcentrations of thyroid hormone, the pituitary gland secretes thyroid-stimulating hormone\n(TSH) to regulate thyroid function [Cunane, pp 120]. An elevated serum TSH concentration\n\nindicates primary hypothyroidism; in contrast, decrease in TSH concentration reflects\nhyperthyroidism [Lindh, pp 151].\nEffects of Iodine Deficiency\nHypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism are conditions caused by the amount of iodine in\nthe body moving outside the range required for optimal health. Even though both conditions can\noccur, hypothyroidism is much more common in the world. Not consuming enough iodine can\nlead to Iodine Deficiency Disorders (I.D.D.). These disorders vary depending on the age of the\nperson, but the two most common ones associated with iodine deficiency are goiter and\ncretinism. Goiter is a condition resulting from the thyroid gland becoming enlarged in an attempt\nto be more efficient at obtaining iodine, whereas cretinism is a condition resulting in mental\ndeficiency [Fuge, pp 417]. How common is iodine deficiency? The answer is that in 1990, the\nU.N. and W.H.O. estimated that about 1 billion people are at risk for I.D.D. [Cherian and\nNordberg, pp 189]. This statistic includes 211 million people with goiter, and 5.1 million people\nwith cretinism [189]. In severely iodine deficiency areas, the inhabitants have a mean I.Q. loss of\n13.5 points [Fuge, pp 417]. The loss in I.Q. points is an expected result of iodine deficiency: it\n\"impairs at least two key aspects of lipid metabolism in the developing mammalian brain---\nketogenesis for energy metabolism and myelin synthesis\" [Cunnane, pp 129]. While the terrible\neffects of iodine deficiency are seen around the world, their causes have explanations: iodine\ndeficiency is the result of many factors, the most important ones being geological and cultural.\nGeological impact on Iodine Deficiency\nDepending on a person's location around the world, the iodine content in the soil varies.\nIodine is most abundant in the sea and along the seashore; as a person moves inland from the sea,\nthe iodine concentration of the soil decreases, representing a negative correlation between\n\ndistance from the sea and amount of iodine concentration in the soil [Fuge, pp 421]. Most\ngeologists believe that little iodine in the secondary environment is derived from weathering of\nthe lithosphere [Fuge, pp 418]. The result of these observations is that iodine deficiency\ndisorders tend to be geographically defined, most common in high mountain ranges, rain shadow\nareas, and central continental regions; these affected regions correspond to a high occurrence of\nI.D.D. in the central regions of South America, Africa, and Asia [Fuge, pp 418]. Of course, these\nstudies suggest that central regions of Western Europe and North America should be affected by\nI.D.D., and that island regions like New Guinea should not see cases of I.D.D. In contrast, the\noccurrence of I.D.D. is reversed for these areas; what accounts for these anomalies?\nCultural Effects on Iodine Deficiency Disorder\nThe answer is that the occurrence of I.D.D. is also influenced by culture. Two particular\ncase studies reveal how the government and the interaction between different cultures can lead to\nI.D.D. in one country and not the other. The first case study looks at iodine deficiency in\nEngland during the 20th century; this is an example of culture helping to decrease I.D.D. cases.\nBritish research in the 1920s revealed that iodine supplementation improved livestock\nreproductive performance [Duncan and Scott, pp 250]. As a result of the research, English\nfarmers fed more iodine to their cattle in order to increase their profits [Duncan and Scott pp\n250]. At the same time, government policies lead to an increase in the consumption of milk\nthroughout the country [Duncan and Scott, pp 250]. The result: endogenous infant mortality rates\ndecreased as iodine intake increased [Duncan and Scott, pp 250]. English culture---scientific\nresearch, government policies, and English cultural practices---lead to a decrease in I.D.D.\namong the British population, even though iodine deficiency was widespread prior to the 20th\ncentury because inland soils were lacking proper amounts of iodine.\n\nThe other case study was completed by an anthropologist from Queens College:\nGeorgeda Buchbinder. Her study involved a \"recently located\" tribe in New Guinea called the\nMaring. According to Buchbinder, endemic goiter and cretinism occurred in the Maring tribe as\na result of cultural contact between the Maring and other cultures [Buchbinder, pp 106]. She\nnoted that the only main source of iodine in the diet of the Maring was the salt that they locally\nmanufactured by the sea [Buchbinder, pp 113]. After coming into contact with the outside world,\nnon-iodized trade salt was substituted in their culture, resulting in a deficiency of iodine in their\ndiet [Buchbinder, pp 114]. Buchbinder studied the Maring over many years, from the time when\nthey were discovered by outsiders, up until the time when she concluded that the rise in goiter\nand cretinism in the Maring population was a direct result of cultural interaction. Both case\nstudies by Duncan, Scott and Buchbinder show that I.D.D. can occur as a result of the culture in\nwhich a person is living. Furthermore, geological studies reveal that the geological occurrence of\niodine in the soils around the world contributes to I.D.D. The important conclusion to make is\nthat in order to properly study deficiencies and toxicities, the scientist needs to look at a\nmultiplicity of factors that could be causing the particular illness in society.\nSymptoms of Iodine Deficiency Disorder\nNow that the main causes of I.D.D. have been examined, how do you know if you have\nit? First of all, goiter and cretinism are the two most easily recognizable signs of I.D.D. More\nexperimental methods include measuring iodine content in the soil using certain reactive\nchemicals, potentiometry, and neutron activation analysis. The blood of a person suspected of\nhaving I.D.D. can be analyzed and compared against normal clinical values of iodine for healthy\nadults: urinary concentration should be greater than 1000 μg/L, serum T4 concentration should\nbe in the range of 60-100 μg/L, and serum TSH concentration should be in the range of 1-50\n\nμg/L [Combs, pp 175]. For Americans, iodine concentration isn't usually monitored in the blood\nbecause the government has taken certain actions to prevent iodine deficiency in America.\nPrevention of Iodine Deficiency\nAs mentioned in the end of the last paragraph, there are methods that can prevent iodine\ndeficiency. The first step in preventing iodine deficiency is accepting the fact that iodine is an\nessential trace element; both deficiencies and toxicities can create major health problems. Once a\nsociety recognizes the link between iodine and health, they can prevent the occurrence of iodine\ndeficient health problems by providing people with iodine supplements, iodized oil, food\nfortified with iodine, and/or iodized salt. The last measure---using iodized salt---is the most\ncommon method for combating iodine deficiency because most cultures use salt. In fact, the\nWorld Health Organization (W.H.O.), and the United Nations Children's Fund (U.N.I.C.E.F.)\nare currently using iodized salt as their most common method for preventing iodine deficiency\naround the world.\nConclusion\nIodine is important to all humans, not only chemists working in the laboratory. The\nthyroid gland needs iodine to make thyroid hormones, which regulate proper body functioning.\nNot enough iodine intake in a person's diet leads to iodine deficiency disorders; too much iodine\nin the diet---although much less common in the world---can have unwanted toxic effects, ones\nthat are somewhat similar to the effects caused by iodine deficiency. Goiter and cretinism are the\ntwo most common disorders relating to iodine deficiency. Unfortunately, soil composition and\ncultural interaction lead to iodine deficiency around the world. On the other hand, humans are\nfortunate in that they can take measures that will prevent the occurrence of iodine deficiency.\n\nThe most widely used preventive method is seen by looking in your cupboard and noticing the\ncontainer of salt that is iodized to keep you healthy.\n\nREFERENCES\nAtkins and Jones.

      "content": "U.S. Environmental Health Effects and Treatment of Mercury Exposure\n\nIAP 2006, 12.091 Medical Geology/Geochemistry Term Paper\nSergio Navarro\nDepartment of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences,\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology,\n30 January 2006\n\nAbstract:\nThe various methods of treatment to\nmercury toxicity in the human body have\nbeen studied and investigated with\nsomewhat mixed conclusions. This paper\ndiscusses the various types of mercury, the\ncycle of mercury in the environment, human\nexposure to mercury and treatment, and\nmethods of reducing mercury pollution and\nits effect in the human population in the U.S.\n\nKeywords: Methylmercury, exposure to\nmercury.\n\nThe effect of mercury on humans has\nbeen observed for centuries now. The 80th\nelement in the periodic table has been\nhistorically used for various purposes over\nthe history of man, from making felt hats\nto thermometers and medical equipment.\nDental fillings in the past were made using\nmercury amalagams. However, in addition\nto explaining and exploring the effects of\nmercury toxicity in the human body, it is\nequally vital to understand possible ways\nto both treat and reduce exposure of\nmercury to vulnerable human\npopulations. These topics\nhave not been well studied\nover time. This paper will\nexplore these areas and\ninclude recommendations for\nareas where mercury\nexposure should be reduced.\nMercury is found in nature\nin two main molecular forms,\nan organic and an inorganic\nform. It is manufactured by\nthe reduction of cinnabar, which is a\nreaction where oxygen and cinnabar (HgS)\nare reacted to produce mercury (Hg) and\nsulfur dioxide (SO2). Both forms are\ndangerous and toxic in both a liquid and\nvapor state, however the inorganic form\nposes a higher risk to humans for the risk\nof poisoning. This is because it more easily\npermeates cell membranes and can\naccumulate in the brain. The organic form\n- produced from inorganic mercury by\nbacteria in the water system after it enters\nit - is a neurotoxin that can cause serious\nnervous system damage and the brain. This\nform is often caused by linking the\nmercury metallic ion with a methyl side\ngroup, making a methylmercury\ncompound. This form of mercury\nespecially poses a danger to the developing\nfetus and comes from the ingestion of fish.\nThe inorganic form, commonly used in\nmedical equipment and dental fillings, is\nalso a neurotoxin and particularly affects\nthe liver. Toxicity cases of this form come\nmost commonly from inhalation during\nmanufacturing processes or after a spill.\n\nFig. 1. Mercury cycle in the environment.\n\nFigure 1 is pictorial representation of the\nproduction, flow, and accumulation of\nmercury in the atmosphere. fish with the\nhighest concentration of mercury levels are\nat the top of the hydrospheric food chain.\n\nThe single largest source of mercury\npollution in the atmosphere is due to the\nburning of coal in electrical production\nfacilities. The mercury that exists naturally\nin the bituminous coal and cinnabar is\nreleased into the atmosphere at a much\nhigher concentration than background\nlevels expected to be seen from natural\ngeological processes. Studies estimate that\nclose to 75% of global mercury emissions\nare attributable to human activity. Once\nmercury has been emitted into the\natmosphere, it is often deposited into\naqueous bodies, such as lakes and oceans.\nDivalent mercury, an ionic form of\ninorganic mercury, is more easily bonded\nto particles and quickly dissolves in water.\nSoon after being deposited into water,\nmicroorganisms transform this form into\nthe aforementioned methylmercury. It is\nimportant to mention that methylmercury\ncan be converted back into its elemental\nform and then reemitted into the\natmosphere, causing this cycle to continue.\nFig. 2 Sources of mercury pollution.\nFigure 2. indicates sources of mercury\npollution. As visible, the burning of coal for both\nutility and industrial purposes account for 52%\nof total mercury emission.\nThe ability of mercury to travel long\ndistances through its water cycle and air\ncycle have an unexpected effect on areas\nthat lack heavy industry; a particular\nregion may have low-level contamination\nof mercury without any mercury-related\nhuman activity; for instance, a case in the\nwoods of Wisconsin pose one such\nexample, where moderate levels of\nmercury were found despite the lack of any\npossible sources of mercury pollution.\nOnce in the hyrdrosphere,\nmethylmercury can accumulate at\nextremely high concentrations in the\ntissues of freshwater biological creatures.\nThese organisms eat plants that often\ncontain mercury and are exposed to\nmercury in the water. The concentration of\nmercury in a shellfish often can be more\nthan ten thousand times the concentration\nfound in the water in its environment. This\nis due to the fact that methymercury\naccumulates as the organism filters water\nthrough its body and continually consumes\nsmaller mercury-containing creatures.\nLarger creatures including predatory fish,\nbirds, and humans continue to accumulate\nmore and more\namounts of mercury\nin their bodies as they\neat these fish. One\nEPA report to\nCongress indicated\nthat up to 30% of the\nmale loon population\nin the U.S. northeast\ncould have mercury\nlevels high enough to\ncause adverse health\neffects.\nSources of Mercury Pollution\nManufacturing\nResidential boilers\nHazardous waste\nMedical waste\nCoal, industrial\nMunicipal waste\nCoal, utility\nOther sources\nFigure 3 is the USGS map of deposition of\nmercury from the atmosphere in the United\n\nStates. It is evident that the northern and\neastern parts of the United States have\nespecially higher amounts of mercury\ndeposition.\n\nExposure to Mercury\nThere exist three major areas of\ncontamination of mercury that pose serious\nrisks to human populations. First, hospitals\nand health-care facilities have medical\nequipment that contains mercury.\nSecondly, manufacturing and power plants\nburn coal and sludge, directly producing\nmercury. Incineration of solid waste also is\nanother source of mercury from this area.\nLastly, the direct consumption of\nfreshwater and seawater fish is a possible\nrisk source.\nThe first source of mercury\ncontamination is most especially a risk to\nthose with occupations in biomedical\nfacilities. The inhalation of mercury vapors\ndue to spills can lead to serious health\nconsequences; as a spill can cause mercury\nconcentrations in the indoor air to quickly\nbecome much higher than recommended\nlevels. Biomedical experiments involving\nmethylmercury have also been shown to be\npotentially fatal. One mentioned case\ninvolved a researcher that was exposed to\nseveral drops of methylmercury onto her\ngloved hand during a laboratory\nexperiment - she developed neurological\ntoxicity symptoms after two months and\ndied despite aggressive treatment. A recent\nstudy in Turkey also indicates that dentists\nhave significant exposure mercury vapor\nand are most likely subject to long-term\nadverse affects due to mercury toxicity.\nLevels of mercury in urine of the dentists\nwere about three times the amount of\ncontrol subjects in the study (Karahalil\n2005).\nThe last source, the consumption of fish,\nis the most common source of mercury\ntoxicity. Because mercury ions bind tightly\nto the sulfur-containing side groups of\namino acids in the body, the high-protein\ndensity parts of the fish - muscle - there is\nno way to prepare or cook fish to reduce\nthe amount of mercury in a dish or meal.\nExposure to mercury is potentially\ndeadly to all organisms; however, more\nserious is the subtle, chronic exposure to\nlow levels of mercury in the diet. This\nexposure poses special risks to human\nfetuses, infants, and children, possibly\ncausing serious obstacles to natural\nneurological development. Studies have\nestablished tenuous links between IQ,\nmemory, attention, and language skill\ndevelopment of children and exposure to\nmoderate levels of methylmercury during\ntheir gestation period (NIH 2006).\nHowever, there is still extensive debate\nand research into these connections. A\nstudy of the Faroe Islands by Grandjean\nappears to link the lowered IQ with the\neffects of mercury, while other studies by\nMyers (2003) and Kjellstrom (1989) have\nshown mixed conclusions on the matter. It\nappears that additional studies and research\nare required to establish firm relationships\nbetween IQ levels and exposure to\nmercury.\nImmediate symptoms of mercury\ntoxicity include the following common\nneurological symptoms: impairment of the\nperipheral vision; numbness and the loss of\nfeeling; tingling sensations along the\nlimbs; lack of coordination of movement;\nthe impairment of speech, hearing,\nwalking; muscle weakness; dramatic mood\nswings; memory loss; mental disturbance.\nIt is usually quite easy to recognize the\nsymptoms of high-level mercury\npoisoning; however, the mid-level mercury\ntoxicity often can go undiagnosed or\nmisdiagnosed.\n\nExposure Treatment:\n\nImmediate exposure to mercury requires\ntreatment as soon as possible and medical\nattention. For eye contact, it is\nrecommended to wash the eyes quite\nrigorously for 15 minutes and then receive\nmedical attention. For direct skin contact,\nit is recommended to rinse the area\ncontinuously for 15 minutes and remove\nall contaminated clothing and get medical\ntreatment as soon as possible. For\ninhalation of mercury vapor, it is\nimperative to find a fresh air source and\nreceive artificial respiration if breathing\nstops. In the case of ingestion, vomiting\nshould be induced immediately.\nThe toxicity limit for mercury in the\nadult human body is about 3 pg/g of\ncreatinine. Concentrations of mercury well\nbeyond this amount can cause considerable\nadverse long-term health effects. Most\ndetoxification techniques attempt to lower\nmercury concentration well under this\nlevel.\nThese detoxification techniques involve\nremoving mercury from the body using\n'chelation,' complexing the mercury to a\nbigger molecule. The three different main\nchelation techniques involve different\nmolecules: DMPS, EDTA, DMSA. These\ndetoxification techniques are used as a\ndiagnostic tool to determine concentration\nof Hg in blood and decrease overall\nmercury concentration. The idea behind\nchelation involves a molecule used as a\nchelator, because Hg is usually embedded\nin cell walls. The chelator picks up Hg by\nattachment to a sulfur-side group and then\nexchanges Hg-molecule for a metal with a\nhigher stability constant. The chelator\npicks up mercury molecules and safely\ntakes it through intestines until excretion.\nFor the case of DMPS and EDTA, the\ntechnique is conducted by delivering the\npowdered form of the molecule in solution\nby intravenous (IV) infusion, while for\nDMSA, an IV is usually not required.\nDMPS is the common chelation technique\nfor adults while DMSA is used to treat\nmercury toxicity in children. The DMPS\ntechnique appears to have been originally\ndeveloped in China, and can also be used\nto remove other heavy metals from the\nhuman body (Smith 2005).\nDuring chelation procedure, several\nsupplements are recommended for\nconsumption, including prochitosan -\nincreases the rate of digestion, garlic -\nincreases sulfur concentration, and\ncilantro, vitamin C, and vitamin E -\ndecrease side effects of 'chelation.' It is\nalso recommended to eat a high-protein\ndiet during chelation while avoid foods\nhigh in sugar. The sulfur-side groups in the\namino acids from protein help facilitate\nchelation.\n\nFig. 3 Natural Atmospheric Mercury\nDeposition.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection\nAgency has issued specific diet\nrecommendations for expecting mothers\nand young children in regard to the\nconsumption of fish and shellfish.\nAdherence to these recommendations will\nhelp ensure that these women and children\n\nwill avoid harmful exposure to the effects\nof mercury toxicity. First, the consumption\nof predatory fish - shark, tilefish,\nswordfish, king mackerel, albacore tuna -\nshould be avoided. They contain the\nhighest concentrations of mercury out of\nall fish. Second, refrain from eating more\nthan 12 ounces of fish and shellfish that are\nlower in mercury - shrimp, light tuna,\nsalmon, and pollock - concentration in a\nweek. Lastly, keep track of the latest\nadvisories issued about the mercury\ncontent of fish caught locally (EPA 2004).\nMercury was banned in the United States\nas a paint additive in both exterior and\ninterior paints in 1990 and 1991. The EPA\nis also working to phase mercury out of\nbatteries.\nThe Great Waters program and its\nreports to Congress have been useful to\ngathering information about specific\nmercury levels and deposition in the\nUnited States (EPA 2000). Additionally,\nalternative metals to mercury are being\nimplemented in medical equipment. The\nEPA has also prepared a power plant\nmercury regulation plan to reduce emission\nof mercury in the United States (EPA\n2000). In my opinion, the most logical way\nto reduce exposure of mercury to the\nhuman population may be to increase\ntesting abilities for mercury levels in fish\nand water sources and to increase overall\nawareness of fish dietary recommendations\nto women of child-bearing age. Any other\nmethod may be vastly more expensive and\ndifficult.\nZeller and Booth have suggested that by\noverall cost-benefit analysis of mercury\nregulation, we may see that over a 15-year\nperiod the nation would face losses ranging\nfrom $60 billion to $1 billion due to loss in\nchildren's IQ affecting the national net\nincome (Zeller and Booth 2005).\n\nConclusions:\n\nFrom the studies and research of the\neffects of mercury on both human\npopulations and the environment, it is\nevident that mercury toxicity is a serious\nproblem that can not be easily overlooked.\nThe long-term effects of low-level\nexposure to mercury through fish\nconsumption need to be seriously\nconsidered. It is also equally important to\ncontinue to try to understand possible ways\nto both treat and reduce exposure of\nmercury to human populations. These\ntopics have not been well studied over time\nand more research should shed more light\non this topic in the future. Additionally,\nthis paper focused on environmental health\neffects and treatment of mercury exposure\nin the United States; it may well be the\ncase that situations are much serious in\nother parts of the world were coal-burning\nand the production of mercury near water\nsources is more common, such as China.\n\nReferences:\nMercury influence on biochemical processes of the human organism.
