They were eager for the war against\nMithridates because it promised much plunder, and they\nfeared that Marius would enlist other soldiers instead of\nthemselves. Sulla spoke of the indignity put upon him by\nSulpicius and Marius, and while he did not openly allude\nto anything else (for he did not dare as yet to mention\nthis sort of war), he urged them to be ready to obey his\norders. They understood what he meant, and as they\nfeared lest they should miss the campaign they uttered\nboldly what Sulla had in mind, and told him to be of good\ncourage, and to lead them to Rome...\nFrom The Civil Wars by Appian.

He sought a god to be his helper and depended on the\nsoldiers and size of the army only in second place. For he thought that\nthat was of no use anyway without the help of a god. He considered\ndivine aid to be invincible and unconquerable.\nSo now he thought seriously about which god he should enlist as\nhelper, and it crossed his mind that most previous rulers had put their\nhopes in several gods when they came to power and had worshipped\nthem with offerings of wine, sacrifices and votive offerings. Having been\ninitially deceived by positive prophecies and oracles that promised good\nauspices, they did not, however, come to an auspicious end. Not one of\nthe gods had stood by them to protect them from the ruin which was\ndestined by heaven.\n(c) Translation copyright unknown. All rights reserved.

And when\nConstantine's mother, Helena, was saddened by this atrocity and was\ninconsolable at the young man's death, Constantine, as if to comfort her, applied\na remedy worse than the disease: he ordered a bath to be overheated, and shut\nFausta up in it until she was dead.\nSince he was himself aware of his guilt and of his disregard for oaths as well,\nhe approached the priests seeking absolution, but they said that there was no\nkind of purge known which could absolve him of such impieties.\nA certain Egyptian, who had come from Spain to Rome and was intimate with\nthe ladies of the court, met Constantine and assured him that the Christian\nreligion was able to absolve him from guilt and that it promised every wicked man\nwho was converted to it immediate release from all sin. Constantine readily\nbelieved what he was told and, abandoning his ancestral religion, embraced the\none which the Egyptian offered him.\n(c) Translation copyright unknown. All rights reserved.

A precedent has been\ncreated in government; in the recent past, armed force restored the\ntribunes' veto; now armed force is repressing and overriding it...The\ndecree calling upon the magistrates to act to save the State from\nharm...was never passed before now except in the case of pernicious\nlegislation, or violence by tribunes, or a mutiny of the people, when the\ntemples and heights commanding the city were seized; and these earlier\nprecedents were atoned for by the fates of Saturninus and the Gracchi.\nBut in the present instance, none of these things has taken place, or even\nbeen contemplated; there has been no law proposed, no attempt to\nappeal to the people, no mutiny.\nI have been your commander for nine years; under my\nleadership, your efforts on Rome's behalf have been crowned with good\nfortune; you have won countless battles and have pacified the whole of\nGaul and Germany. Now, I ask you to defend my reputation (existimatio)\nand standing (dignitas) against the assaults of my enemies.'\nThe Civil War by Caesar. Translated by Jane P. Gardner.

For more information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/help/faq-fair-use/.\n\nSuetonius, Julius 30\n[Caesar intended] to resort to war if the senate took\nany drastic action against the tribunes of the\ncommons who interposed vetoes in his behalf. Now\nthis was his excuse for the civil war, but it is believed\nthat he had other motives. Gnaeus Pompeius used to\ndeclare that since Caesar's own means were not\nsufficient to complete the works which he had\nplanned, nor to do all that he had led the people to\nexpect on his return, he desired a state of general\nunrest and turmoil...\n\nOthers say that he dreaded the necessity of rendering an\naccount for what he had done in his first consulship\ncontrary to the auspices and the laws, and regardless of\nvetoes; for Marcus Cato often declared, and took oath too,\nthat he would impeach Caesar the moment he had\ndisbanded his army. It was openly said too that if he was\nout of office on his return, he would be obliged, like Milo, to\nmake his defence in a court hedged about by armed men.\nThe latter opinion is the more credible one in view of the\nassertion of Asinius Pollio, that when Caesar at the battle of\nPharsalus saw his enemies slain or in flight, he said, word\nfor word: 'They would have it so. Even I, Gaius Caesar,\nafter so many great deeds, should have been found guilty,\nif I had not turned to my army for help.'\nFrom Suetonius: The Lives of the Twelve Caesars. Translated by J.C. Rolfe.
