Focuses on the conceptual phase of product definition include technical, economic, market, environmental, regulatory, legal, manufacturing, and societal factors. Subject centers on a realistic system case study and includes a number of lectures from industry and government. Past examples included the Very Large Transport Aircraft, a Supersonic Business Jet and a Next Generation Cargo System. Subject identifies the critical system level issues and analyzes them in depth via student team projects and individual assignments. The overall goal of the semester is to produce a business plan and a system specifications document that can be used to assess candidate systems.\n\nSpring 2004 Plan\n\nAir freight represents the fastest growing segment of commercial air transportation, with a projected annual growth rate around 6%. The largest market opportunity is for intercontinental transport, particularly from Asian markets. Currently shippers have two choices for transoceanic freight: relatively fast but expensive air freight or relatively slow but inexpensive sea transport. At present, approximately 99% of the freight (by volume) is carried by ships. If the top 1 or 2% of this demand could be captured, it would represent a huge increase in the airfreight market. Such an increase would require much larger cargo capacity than current aircraft can support, more competitive prices, and likely new system concepts.\n\nU.S. military operations continue to respond to international threats, yet need to rely on continental United States (CONUS) basing. The current system requires substantial tanker support, often from non-CONUS bases, to reach global targets. Recent studies show that the true cost of a gallon of gas delivered by a tanker can approach $1XX, while the same gallon of gas pumped on the ground in CONUS is $1.XX. There is a growing need for long range, fuel efficient transport of military cargo which can rely on CONUS basing.\n\nVarious concepts are being explored to meet the growing demand for commercial and military cargo aircraft. These include large conventional aircraft such as the A-380, the Boeing Blended Wing Body (BWB) configuration, and Wing in Ground Effect (WIG) aircraft such as the Pelican, and lighter than air vehicles. A possible concept which remains largely unexplored is the exploitation of formation flight for conventional aircraft. Flight tests conducted within the past two years have demonstrated 12-18% fuel flow reduction for a trailing F/A-18 aircraft in a two aircraft formation. Various calculations show fuel flow reductions of 15-20% are likely for small formations. Such a large improvement in aircraft efficiency opens the possibility of radically new capability for long haul cargo aircraft.\n\nIt is expected that autonomous or semi-autonomous systems will be required to eliminate pilot workload. Systems have been demonstrated which allow two aircraft to fly in tight formations using instrumentation. Such technologies might be applicable to formation flight for other applications than cargo transport; e.g. formation landing, UAVs, long endurance high altitude missions.\n\nThe Spring 2004 16.886 class will investigate the possibility of exploiting formation flight for significant new capability for long haul commercial and military cargo. All aspects related to system concepts should be explored including, but not limited to, the number and placement of aircraft in a formation, mix of aircraft size and payload / fuel fractions, aircraft and formation stability and control, degree of autonomy, concepts for formation rendezvous and dispersal, economic, safety, environmental factors, etc.. The size of the class will determine the number of topics that will be explored in depth.\n\nThe final deliverables for the class will be a written report and accompanying briefing which lays out the feasibility of formation flight for long haul cargo aircraft, candidate system specifications, and gaps in knowledge needed to realize the proposed concept(s). The audiences for these deliverables are decision makers in industry and government, and the engineering community as represented by an AIAA technical conference. The report should include a one page executive summary, a main body of a length and content suitable for a conference paper, and appendices as needed for detailed analysis.\n\nThe class will be organized into a single integrated program team tasked with developing the final deliverable by the end of the semester. During the first three weeks, students will individually review the existing literature and other sources of information in one area relevant to the class project (e.g. formation flight aerodynamics, commercial freight markets, competing system concepts, etc.). This phase will end with a short oral presentation by each student to inform the rest of the class about the body of knowledge. Overlapping this phase and continuing on beyond, the class will work as a team to develop system concepts and the supporting analysis or rationale. An oral System Concept Review will be presented before spring break. At this point several system concepts may be reviewed, and the most promising of them will be selected for further analysis. Several weeks after spring break, a more detailed Preliminary System Design will be presented. This will afford the faculty and class an opportunity to assess progress and give input to proposed system concept and system level requirements. The final weeks of the semester will concentrate on finalizing the proposed system concept and system level requirements, and preparing the written and oral deliverables due at the end of the semester.\n\nIt is possible that some students in a two-quarter class at Stanford University will address a detailed level preliminary trade study design at the vehicle level. Collectively the MIT and Stanford students could form a loosely coupled single team executing conceptual and preliminary design trade studies to arrive at a viable and feasible system and vehicle concept. Various mechanisms will be established to enable interchange of information such as Video links of Reviews, e-mail, on-line chat rooms, etc.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nHardcopies of lectures will be distributed at the start of each class.\n\nCourse faculty do not have regularly scheduled office hours and are available as needed. Contact them directly in person or by e-mail to schedule a time to meet.\n\nDeliverables and Grading\n\nDELIVERABLES\n\nWEIGHTS\n\nINDIVIDUAL OR TEAM GRADES\n\nIndividual Oral Presentation\n\n15%\n\nIndividual\n\nSystem Concept Review\n\n15%\n\nTeam\n\nPreliminary System Design\n\n15%\n\nTeam\n\nFinal Oral Presentation\n\n20%\n\nTeam\n\nFinal Written Report\n\n25%\n\nTeam\n\nEnd of Course Interview\n\n10%\n\nIndividual",

      "content": "AIAA/ICAS International Air and Space Symposium and Exposition: The Next 100 Year\nAIAA 2003-2629\n14-17 July 2003, Dayton, Ohio\nAIAA-2003-2629\nFUTURE CONCEPTS FOR AIR CARGO DELIVERY\nABSTRACT\nAir cargo delivery is a vital part of today's air\ntransportation industry and is also an area of\naviation whose future continues to evolve and\ndevelop. While taking a brief look back in to the\nhistory of air cargo delivery, this paper will\nexamine current methods of air cargo delivery\nand also discuss potential concepts for the future\nof air cargo delivery and the markets to which\nthey might be applied.\nBACKGROUND\nIt is appropriate to look back to the birth of air\ncargo with the first use of aerial mail\ntransportation as far back as 1870 when in that\nyear letters were carried out of Paris by free\nballoons, cast adrift in the winds. The first of\nsuch flights were made on September 23, 1870,\nand carried 500 pounds of mail. This service\noffered 2 to 3 flights per week. A total of 65\nflights were made carrying over two billion\nletters. In 1911, demonstrations of airplane mail\nservices were made in India, England and the\nUnited States. The first airmail service in the\nUnited States was conducted at the aviation\nmeeting at Nassau Boulevard, Long Island, N.Y.,\nduring the week of September 23rd, 1911. Earle\nL. Ovington, with his \"Queen\" monoplane, was\nduly appointed an air mail carrier and covered a\nset route between the temporary post office\nestablished at the flying field and the post office\nat Mineola, N.Y., dropping the mail pouches at\nthe latter point for the postmaster to pick up. A\ntotal of 32,415 post cards, 3,993 letters and 1,062\ncirculars were carried.\nRon Barkowski\nFedEx Express\nMemphis, Tennessee\nFigure 1 JN-4H \"Jenny\"\nThe beginning of the civil cargo aircraft started\nduring\nthe\nyear\nwhen\nCongress\nappropriated $100,000 to the Post Office\nDepartment\nfor\nthe\ndevelopment\nof\nan\nexperimental airmail service. With these funds,\nthe Post Office Department was able to purchase,\nmaintain and operate what was called in those\ndays \"aeroplanes\". The development and use of\nlarge military bombing planes during World War\nI demonstrated that these \"aeroplanes\" could be\nused for fast commercial and mail transportation.\nThe first aircraft used for airmail was the Curtis\nJN-4H \"Jenny\" with a payload of 200 pounds\nbulk at 75 mph and a ceiling of 6500 ft.\nFigure 2 Handley Page V/1500\nIn November of 1919, American Railway\nExpress Company inaugurated the first full scale\nendeavor of an air express services in the United\nStates. The airplane selected by the express\ncompany was the Handley Page V/1500, which\nhad an approximate payload of 7,500 pounds and\na wingspan of 126 feet.\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\nCopyright (c) 2003 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. All rights reserved.\n\nFigure 3 Douglas DC-4\nThe next significant development in air cargo\ndelivery came during the Word War II timeframe\nwith the development of the Douglas DC-3 and\nDC-4 aircraft. The Douglas DC-4, a passenger\naircraft developed prior to WWII, was converted\nto a cargo aircraft and had the military\ndesignation C-54 \"Skymaster\" in 1942.\nThe\nU.S. Navy used the aircraft to provide rapid air\ndelivery of critical equipment, spare parts, and\nspecialist personnel to naval activities and fleet\nforces worldwide. The C-54 had a split Main\nCargo Door located aft of the wing.\nSimilar aircraft of this same type included\naircraft such as the Curtis C-46 Commando, the\nLockheed Constellation L-649 and the Douglas\nC-74 Globemaster which had a payload capacity\nof 48,000 pounds. In 1943, American Airlines\nbegan operating the first transcontinental all-\ncargo\nservices\nwith\nDC-3\nair-freighters.\nAmerican Airlines was the first airline to offer a\nservice of this type. In June of 1946 American\nAirlines was the first airline to provide scheduled\nservice with a four-engine DC-4 air-freighter.\nAlso, American Airlines used both DC-6A air-\nfreighters (beginning in 1953) and DC-7 combi\naircraft (an aircraft that carries both cargo and\npassengers on the main deck), to continue to set\nrecords for carrying cargo. Slick Airways\noperated DC-4, DC-6 (first pure freighters),\nCurtis C-46, CL-44D4-6 (Canadair) and L-1049\nSuper Constellation as cargo aircraft.\nThe CL-44D4-6, used by Slick Airways, was a\nunique aircraft in that the entire tail sections\nwould swing open allowing for the loading of\nlong oil pipes. Eventually Slick Airways and\nFlying Tigers Line became one airline which, in\nturn, eventually was merged with Federal\nExpress Corporation in 1989.\nFigure 4 Lockheed L-1049 \"Super Constellation\"\nFigure 5 Canadair CL-44D4-6\nThe Douglas DC-7 was the last of the Douglas\npropeller-powered transports. Introduced in May\n1953, it entered service with American Airlines\nin November 1953. It was the first commercial\ntransport able to fly nonstop westbound across\nthe United States against the prevailing winds.\nThe DC-7 like the DC-6 had a main cargo door\naft of the wing on the left side of the aircraft and\nforward of the wing on the left side as well.\nThe U.S. civilian cargo jet era began with the\nintroduction of the Boeing B707-321C model in\n1963 with a Main Deck Cargo Door. Pan Am\nairlines was the first airline to operate the Boeing\n707-321C jet freighter. Jets were already flying\nfor passenger carriers since 1952 when the first\nDe Havilland Comet 1 was delivered to British\nOverseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and\nwhen the first commercial Boeing 707-121 was\ndelivered to Pan Am in October 26, 1958.\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n-8\nFigure 6 Douglas DC\nThe DC-8 was the first Douglas jet-powered\ntransport. It entered service simultaneously with\nUnited Airlines and Delta Air Lines on\nSeptember 18, 1959 as a passenger aircraft.\nLater, in 1963, Douglas incorporated a freighter\nconfiguration to the family of DC-8's for cargo\noperations. During the same year Boeing rolled\nout the first B727-100. One of the variants\nincluded a convertible passenger-cargo model\nwith a Quick Change (QC) option as the B727.\nBoeing gave the B737 the same upper lobe\nfuselage as the B707 and B727, so the same\nupper-deck cargo pallets could be used for all\nthree jets.\nCommonality between the B707,\nB727 and B737 fuselage was vital. In February\n1969 the first flight of the B747-100 was\naccomplished which created the first double deck\naircraft for passenger and cargo service.\nCURRENT AIR CARGO DELIVERY\nSince the Wright Flyer was designed and first\nflown in 1903, aircraft have evolved. However,\nthe uses of aircraft have pretty much remained\nthe same.\nAircraft have typically either\ntransported passengers or freight. Today's\nmodern aircraft remain much the same and are\ntending to follow the historical trend of bigger is\nbetter.\nThe freight industry continues to project growth\nin the worldwide freighter fleet. Even though the\nindustry in currently experiencing a decline in\ntraffic similar to, but not as severe as, the\npassenger market, the industry's resilience is\nprojected to prevail and the freighter fleet is\nestimated to double within the next 20 years and\nthat is taking into account the retirement of older\naircraft such as the DC8, DC9, B727 and\nA300F's.\nThe air freight market growth is expected to\ncontinue strongly, reflecting the integral role air\nfreight plays in the global economic growth.\nHistory has shown a doubling of the jet freighter\nfleet every 10 years in order to meet growth.\nWith the significant replacement of many of the\nolder narrow-body freighters with wide-body\naircraft, the majority of the worldwide freighter\nfleet growth will consist of wide-body freighters.\nFigure 7 Douglas MD-11\nFigure 8 Wide-body World Capacity Percentages\nOver the past thirty years a variety of other\naircraft have been developed and have been\nCurrently, the combined wide-body segments\nproduced in a freighter configuration which\ncomprise nearly 40 percent of the world's total\ninclude the DC10, MD11, B767, A300 and A310\nfreighter units.\nto list a few.\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 9 Wide-Body World Freight Capacity\nWithin the next 20 years, that percentage of\nwide-body aircraft is estimated to grow to 60\npercent and will consume approximately 90\npercent of the capacity.\nFigure 10 Average Freighter Capacity Trend\nIn addition, over the past 5 years, average\nfreighter payload has increased about 14 percent.\nOver the next 20 years, the average payload is\nprojected to grow 23 percent, due to the fleet\nreplacement trends mentioned earlier.\nFUTURE AIR CARGO DELIVERY\nWith freighter aircraft trends moving towards the\nlarger wide-body aircraft in significant numbers,\nwhere is this newly found capacity going to be\nused?\nWith the domestic market already well\ndefined and with no new opportunities available,\nexpansion in the worldwide freight market is\nwhere the majority of the growth is expected to\ntake place.\nCurrently, customers are faced with only two\noptions\nfor\ntheir\nintercontinental\nfreight\nshipments, air freight which is fast, reliable and\ncostly or ocean freight which is slow, unreliable\nbut inexpensive.\nFigure 11 Middle Air Freight Market\nWhile air freight is the mode of choice for\nmoving high value freight, the vast majority of\ninternational tonnage travel is by sea. A possible\nfuture unmet market need is for freight service\nthat is faster than ocean shipping and less\nexpensive than shipping by air freight. This\n\"Middle Air Freight\" market could prove to be\nthe next freight frontier in that there is perceived\nto exist an enormous potential.\nCurrently\nthe\nU.S.\nexport\nmarket\nis\napproximately 1.8 MM metric tons of which 62\npercent is transported by sea and the current U.S.\nimport market is approximately 2.7 MM metric\ntones of which 69 percent is transported by sea.\nWhat can be concluded is that if just a small\npercentage (5-10 percent) of the sea traffic were\nto utilize a middle air freight service, the revenue\npotential could be very significant.\nFUTURE CONCEPTS\nIt would seem that one of the key aspects of\nbeing able to capitalize on a potential middle air\nfreight market would be to have a transportation\nsystem that has a very large volume capability.\nTraditionally, freighter aircraft were, and are for\nthe most part, designed to transport people first\nand freight second. Passenger aircraft have\ncertain requirements such as high speed, high\naltitude, pressurized environment, windows,\nexits, emergency equipment, etc, which all\ncontribute additional costs to the design,\nmanufacture and operation of that aircraft. Most\nfreight (export and import) is light, which tends\nto drive the current aircraft utilization to being\nvolume limited thereby not taking advantage of\nthe aircraft's full payload carrying potential.\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nBlended-Wing-Body (BWB)\nThe BWB (Blended Wing Body) is a new\nconcept in aircraft design which offers great\npotential while substantially reducing both\nmanufacturing and acquisition costs while\nimproving aircraft performance and flexibility\nfor both passenger and cargo missions. When\ncompared with conventional configurations, the\nBWB has been found to be superior in all key\nareas. The advantages arise from a combination\nof aerodynamic and structural improvements\nwhich reduce the total wetted area of the airplane\nand lower the weight at the same time that they\nimprove the lift-to-drag ratio. The result may\nprove to be a paradigm shift in the way airplanes\nof the future are designed.\nFigure 12 Boeing Blended-Wing-Body Aircraft\nThe BWB program began in 1993 as a small\nNASA funded study to examine the potential of\nalternate configurations for subsonic transports.\nThis study began with a refined sizing of the\ninitial BWB configuration where minimum\ntakeoff gross weight (TOGW) was set as the\nfigure-of-merit. Primary constraints included an\n11,000-foot takeoff field length, 150-knot\napproach speed, low-speed trimmed Clmax of\n1.7, and a cruise Mach number of .85. Initial\ncruise altitude (ICA) was allowed to vary to\nobtain\nminimum\nTOGW,\nbut\nwith\nthe\nrequirement that the ICA be at least 35,000 feet.\nThis yielded a trapezoidal wing with an aspect\nratio of 10 with a corresponding span of 280 feet\nand an area of 7840 square feet. The resulting\ntrapezoidal wing loading was on the order of 100\nlb/ft^2 - substantially lower that the 150 lbs/ft^2\ntypical of modern subsonic transports.\nThe explanation being that a significant portion\nof the trapezoidal wing is in effect hidden by the\ncenter-body, and therefore the cost of trapezoidal\nwing area on airplane drag is reduced. This in\nturn allowed the airplane to be optimized with a\nlarger trapezoidal area to increase span with a\nrelatively low cost on weight.\nCreation of the original BWB was motivated by\na search for an airplane configuration that could\noffer improved efficiency over the classic tube\nand wing. Takeoff weight and fuel burn were\nthe primary figures of merit, and the BWB\nconcept has shown substantial reductions in\nthese two performance parameters. However,\nthe BWB configuration offers some unique\nopportunities that were neither envisioned nor\nplanned during it original creation in 1993.\nThe BWB is simply a big wing with an\nintegrated fuselage and no empennage, save the\nwinglets/verticals. There are no complex wing-\nfuselage and fuselage-empennage joints of\nhighly loaded structures at 90 degrees to one\nanother, and there are no fillets. All trailing-\nedge control surfaces are simple-hinged with no\ntrack motion, and there are no spoilers. This\nmanifests a substantial reduction (on the order of\n30-percent) in the number of parts when\ncompared to a conventional tube and wing\nconfiguration.\nA\nsimilar\nreduction\nin\nmanufacturing recurring cost is implied.\nThe Blended Wing Body (BWB) airplane\nconcept represents a potential revolution in\nsubsonic transport efficiency for large airplanes.\nThe BWB advantage results from a main cabin\nthat extends span-wise providing structural and\naerodynamic overlap with the wing. This\nreduces the total wetted area of the airplane and\nallows for a long wingspan. A deep and stiff\ncenter-body provides for a very efficient\nstructural wingspan.\nThe projected resulting improvements are:\nFuel Burn\n27% Lower\nTakeoff Weight\n15% Lower\nOperating Empty Weight\n12% Lower\nTotal Thrust\n27% Lower\nLift/Drag\n\n20% Lower\nDOC\n\n15% Lower\nBecause of the inherent efficiencies of the BWB\nconfiguration, this aircraft concept is a very\ninteresting candidate for a middle-market air-\nfreighter.\nUsing the BWB 800 passenger\nconfiguration as a starting point and modifying\nthe configuration to maximize the freight\ncarrying capability while also tailoring some of\nthe performance characteristics to the middle air\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nPayload vs. Range Comparisons\nRange (1000 mi)\nBWB\nPayload (1000 lbs)\nA380F\nB747F\nDC10\nfreight mission, a very interesting aircraft\npercent decrease in direct operating costs when\nemerges.\ncompared to other aircraft currently being\nof approximately 525,000 lbs at a range of\napproximately 5000 nautical miles and having a\npayload volume of approximately 51,000 cubic\nfeet. Also, the BWB would have a cruise speed\nof .85 Mach at an initial cruise altitude of 31,000\nft while maintaining a cabin pressure altitude of\n12,000 ft and being powered by three 90,000 lb-\nclass thrust engines. All this while remaining\nwithin the 80 meter box required to operate out\nof current modern day airports.\nThe resulting criteria for this new air-freighter\nincludes a full double-deck with a 1,350,000 lb\nMaximum Gross Take-Off Weight (MGTOW),\nwhich also happens to match that projected by\nAirbus for the A380F, a maximum gross payload\nPayload vs. Range Comparisons\n\nRange (1000 mi)\nBWB\nPayload (1000 lbs)\nA380F\nB747F\nDC10\nFigure 13 Boeing BWB Three View and Isometric\nBy taking advantage of the performance of such\nan aircraft, while significantly reducing the direct\noperating costs allows the operator to offer a\nvery real middle air-freight alternative to either\nthe high cost of pure air-freight or the very slow\nsea freight modes of transport. The fact that the\nBWB-MF (Middle Freighter) has nearly a 62\npercent payload advantage coupled with a 15\nFigure 14 Payload/Range Comparison\ndeveloped, should make anyone in the freight\nindustry sit up and take notice.\nHybrid Ultra Large Aircraft\nA\ntechnology\nimprovement\nin\nfreight\ntransportation that has been studied and that has\nshown some potential is Hybrid Ultra Large\nAircraft (HULA) using Lighter than Air (LTA)\ntechnology.\nConventional\naircraft\nfreighters,\nwhile\neffectively solving the problem of speed, use\nenormous amounts of fuel at a time when the\nneed to conserve fuel is pressing. Moreover,\ngoods transported by conventional aircraft\nalmost always have to be transferred to another\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nmode of transportation before they can arrive at\ntheir final destination.\nThere is a mode of transportation, however, that\nif allowed to be developed, may be able to solve\nthe problem of speed (as compared to\nconventional ocean shipping) and capacity, in\nthat the vehicle can be designed to carry upwards\nof 2,000,000 pounds of payload. In addition,\nLTA and ULA Hybrids offer excellent fuel\neconomy, as compared to conventional aircraft\ncombined with significant flexibility in that\nfreight can be loaded and off-loaded in\nundeveloped\nareas\nthat\noffer\nvery\nlittle\ninfrastructure.\nThe use of dirigibles to transport enormous\nfreight loads is not new, nor a concept just off\nthe drawing board, still in need of extensive field\ntesting.\nAn inherent advantage of the hybrid\naircraft over conventional aircraft is that through\nthe use of a buoyant aerostatic lift (conventional\naircraft use powered aerodynamic lift), the fuel\ncost of getting and keeping the hybrid aircraft\naloft is a fraction of conventional aircraft.\nOne of the ULA Hybrids currently under\ndevelopment is the AeroCat, by AeroVehicles,\nInc.,\nwhich\ncombines\nthe\nadvantages\nof\naerodynamic lift derived from the lifting-body\nhull shape and the efficiencies of lighter-than-air\nbuoyancy resulting from the helium filled\nenvelope.\nThe fabric used to construct the hull is laminated\nwith an internal catenary system supporting the\npayload module. The aerodynamic shape of the\nhull, an elliptical cross-section allied to a\ncambered longitudinal shape, provides up to 40\npercent of the aircraft's lift. Multiple ballonets\nlocated fore and aft in each of the outer hulls\nprovide pressure control.\n\"Ultra Large\" means just that. These airships are\nvery large, as 3.5 million cubic feet of helium are\nrequired to lift every 100 tons.\nThe 500 ton\ncargo hybrid aircraft is over 800 feet long, 350\nfeet wide, and 180 feet tall, larger than a typical\nsports stadium.\nFigure 15 AeroVehicles, Inc \"AeroCat\"\nThe ULA Hybrid uses a non-rigid shape that\nHybrid aircraft travel at a slower speed than\nprovides 60 percent of its lift using buoyant\naerostatic lift while the remaining 40 percent of\nlift is generated using powered aerodynamic lift\nconventional aircraft because much of their\nefficiency is derived from the 'free lift' of the\nbuoyant gas, and higher speeds drive down that\nwhile in motion.\nefficiency. Hybrid aircraft, however, are still\nmany times faster than ocean going ships (90\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nknots vs. 20 knots). Adding to ground speed, the\nhybrid aircraft also use weather and winds aloft\nto their advantage in a manner similar to a sailing\nship on the ocean.\nThe large size and the total mass of the vehicle\nalso creates high inertia and good stability,\neasing loading and unloading of cargo. The\nAeroCat for example lands either on water and\ntaxis over the shore or lands on a large flat area\nto load and unload.\nCurrent conventional aircraft have specifically\ndesigned universal loading devices (ULD's) that\nthe freight is loaded into prior to being loaded on\nto aircraft. These ULD's are specialized and\ndesigned for weight optimization and aircraft\ncontours.\nload\nresulting from the relatively wide spaced air\ncushion landing system. By reversing the air\ncushion fans on landing, the aircraft is able to\ncreate suction between the ground and itself, thus\nremaining stationary aiding in loading and\nunloading.\nThis attribute eliminates the\nrequirement for large ground crews, elaborate\ntie-down systems, external mooring masts and\nother large support equipment.\nHULA vehicles are no more vulnerable than any\nother high value transportation asset while their\nfailure modes are much more benign, i.e., an\nbuoyant vehicle tends to settle to the ground\nrather than smash into it like an aircraft if it\nsuffers some catastrophe while in flight.

No longer will freight\nhave to be trans-loaded from aircraft ULD's to\nover the road transports.\nAdditionally, the AeroCat ULA Hybrid also has\nthe flexibility to operate from virtually any\nreasonable flat surface land or water, snow or\ndesert, due to the retractable hovercraft type\nlanding system and the stability of a catamaran\nsame as an air-conditioned skyscraper, so the gas\nenvelope is very damage tolerant to holes.\nThe AeroCat HULA is also environmentally\nsensitive in that it does not require large forested\nor protected areas to be altered or paved to\nprovide landing or operating areas.\nNormal\ntakeoffs and landings, at maximum gross weight\nand zero wind can be made within five aircraft\nlengths.\nLower payloads or even slight\nheadwinds shorten the distance considerably,\neven to less than on hull length.\nThis configuration would utilize four engines,\ntwo of which would be positioned forward on\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\neach side of the hull and two positioned on the\nstern points of the hull. All engines would have\nducted propellers complete with directional\nvanes for vectored thrust on takeoff, landing,\ntaxiing and ground operations. Depending on\nthe final size of particular versions, the number\nand orientation of the engines can vary.\nFigure 17 AeroCat Interior Concept\nWith payloads measured in hundreds of tons, and\nconservative cruising speeds of 80-100 knots at\naltitudes less than 10,000 feet using existing\ntechnology to meet air freight needs, HULA's\ndeserve an in depth look. These unique air\nvehicles\ncan\nbe\ndesigned\nfor\nimmediate\nintegration\nwith\ncurrent\ncargo\nshipping\ninfrastructures. Built using existing aircraft\nmanufacturing methods and technology and with\nthe ability to take off and land from undeveloped\nareas carrying standard intermodel containers\ncurrently used with trucks, trains and ships, the\nHULA's have very interesting and significant\npotential.\nRegardless of how big the first HULA may be,\nmany think that this concept could usher in the\nbiggest breakthrough in air-freight transport in\nthe 21st century.\nUltra Large Transport Aircraft\nA concept that, by some, is considered to be on\nthe fringe of practicality is the idea of a large sea\nplane being used for moving large amounts of\nfreight across either the Pacific or Atlantic\noceans.\nOne such concept aircraft is the Pelican Ultra\nLarge Transport Aircraft (ULTRA) currently\nunder study by the Boeing Phantom Works. The\nPelican is a low flying aircraft that basically flies\nin ground effect. By flying close to the water,\nthe wing downwash angle and wing tip vortices\nare suppressed, resulting in a major drag\nreduction and outstanding cruise efficiency. A\nWing in Ground Effect (WIG) provides\nextraordinary range and efficiency.\nWIG vehicles offer a capability to fill the void\nbetween current conventional cargo aircraft and\nthe slow moving ocean ships. WIG vehicles can\noffer the speed of a conventional aircraft while,\nat the same time, being able to transport very\nlarge payloads with a reduced fuel consumption.\nWing\nin\nGround\nEffect\n(WIG)\nis\nthe\nphenomenon described when a cushion of air is\ncreated under an aircraft's wings during landing.\nJust prior to touching down, an air cushion\ndevelops and, unless the pilot changes the shape\nof the wings, the air cushion remains trapped\nbetween the wings and the runway.\nGround effects increases lift and reduces air\nresistance, or drag.\nThe primary reason for\ndeveloping an aircraft to operate in ground effect\nis to obtain the highest possible lift to drag ratio\nso as to reduce the thrust requirements and\nsubsequently, fuel costs.\nWIG vehicles typically fly close to the surface,\ntaking advantage of the reduced drag and\nincrease lift. Although the term used is \"Wing in\nGround Effect\", WIG vehicles typically only fly\nof bodies of water.\nWIG vehicles could provide the size, weight, and\nvolume of lift that is projected for the next 20\nyears. WIG vehicles are hybrid sea and air\nvehicles capable of very heavy lift over long\nranges.\nIt is believed to be technologically\nfeasible to build vehicles that are at least three\ntimes larger and ten times heavier than the\nlargest conventional aircraft.\nFigure 18 Russian KM \"Caspian Sea Monster\"\nDeveloped initially by the Russians in the\n1960's, the first WIG, named the \"Caspian Sea\nMonster\", was capable of lifting 540 tones and\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\ncruised at 310 miles per hour. This vehicle took\noff and landed on the sea and held a steady\naltitude of 10 feet above the surface. Current\nWIG technology has the capability of flying\nbetween 20 and 90 feet above the surface of the\nsea and can cruise at 400 knots. Higher altitudes\nare possible when necessary to transit small land\nmasses or to avoid shipping or other obstacles,\nbut these altitudes cause a significant decrease in\nfuel efficiency.\nDwarfing all previous flying giants is the Pelican\nwhich is a high capacity cargo planes concept\ncurrently being studies by the Boeing Phantom\nWorks. The Pelican would stretch more than the\nlength of a U.S. football field and have a\nwingspan of 500 feet and a wing area in excess\nof an acre. It would also have twice the external\ndimensions of the world's current largest aircraft,\nthe Russian An225, and would be able to\ntransport five times its payload, up to 1,400 tons\nof cargo.\nFigure 19 Boeing Pelican Concept Aircraft\nDesigned primarily for long-range, transoceanic\ntransport, the Pelican would fly as low as 20 feet\nabove the sea, taking advantage \"Wing in\nGround Effect\".\nOver land, it would fly at\naltitudes of 20,000 feet or higher. While\noperating from ordinary paved runways, the\nPelican would use 38 fuselage-mounted landing\ngears with a total of 76 tires to distribute its\nweight. The lateral spacing of the landing gear\nwould be approximately 45 feet with the landing\ngear row of tires being 180 feet in length. Due to\nthe landing gear configuration of the aircraft it is\npresumed that it would demand a \"fly off/fly on\"\nmaneuver using an auto pilot/auto land system.\nAt lift off, and on landing, the deck angle would\nneed to be maintained parallel to the runway to\nassure concurrent contact of all the gear similar\nto the B-52. A crosswind landing gear design\nwould also be needed to align the gears with the\nrunway, again similar to the B-52.\nEight 80,000 lb shaft-horsepower engines would\nbe required to power the Pelican similar to the\n60,000 lb shp GE LM-6000 marine engine. A\nnew marine engine would need to be developed\nbased on the GE90 core.\nThe Pelican is\nconfigured with four engine pods with counter\nrotating propellers having four blades each.\nEach engine pod would contain two engines with\na geared combiner gearbox with either/both of\nthe engines being capable of driving both\npropellers. In low level ground effect cruise, one\nengine in each pod would be throttled to idle to\nimprove specific range.\nWIG vehicles seem to be capable of filling the\nniche between slow moving ships and fast but\nexpensive airplanes.\nWIG vehicles have the\npotential of carrying a larger payload, using less\nfuel for the same size payload as compared to\nconventional freighter aircraft.\nWith a payload of 1.5 million pounds, the\nPelican could fly 10,000 nautical miles over\nwater and 6,500 nautical miles over land.\nFlying in ground effect demands the latest flight\ncontrol technology.\nReliable systems will\nprovide precise, automatic altitude control and\ncollision avoidance. Cruise altitude would be\nadjusted according to sea state, and if the seas\nget too rough, the Pelican would be capable of\nclimbing to a higher altitude and continue the\nflight.\nAlthough the Pelican concept shows a promising\nsolution, it also has some significant challenges\nto overcome. Several areas of risk are present\nand would need to be overcome in order for this\naircraft to come to fruition.\nThese hurdles\ninclude: gearbox and propeller design, marine\nengine development, land gear design, flight\ncontrol systems, bird strike potential and\ncorrosion due to continuous operation over salt\nwater.\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nBefore the airplane even had begun to fly, there\nhas been delivery of air-cargo. In its earliest\nbeginnings it was the balloon and today it is\nlarge jet aircraft. But what is next? What is over\nthe air-freight horizon? It seems that today's\nconventional aircraft has been, and is being,\nutilized in every conceivable way in order to get\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nthe job done and its profit margins can only\nsustain its applicability so far.\nThe intent of this paper has been to present\npossible alternatives to current air cargo delivery\nand how these alternatives might be applied to\npotential future markets.\nThere seem to be several prospective next-\ngeneration air-cargo vehicle possibilities on\nvarious drawing boards today all of which are\ntechnically feasible. Some, if not all, of these\nconcepts are high risk, but the possible rewards\nare also high.\nTube and wing designs have been relatively\nunchanged for decades and the efficiencies of\nthis design have been taken as far as it can go.\nWhat is needed is a leap to the next generation\nfreighter.\nThat leap will require a change in the demands of\nthe transport marketplace as much at it will\nrequire new engineering solutions. The potential\nof the middle air-freight market is readily\napparent, now what is needed is the right\nsolution to be able to properly develop it.\nAcknowledgements\nThe author would like to gratefully acknowledge\nthe contributions to this paper by Dr. Robert R.\nBoyd, Vice President and Chief Technical\nOfficer of AeroVehicles Inc.\nReferences\n1.\nBerrios, J.A.,\"History and Evolution of\nHazardous Material Carried via Aircraft\",\nFedEx Express Engineering Report 02\n046, December 2002.\n2.\nLiebeck, R.H., Page, M.A., and Rawdon\nB.K., \"Blended-Wing-Body Subsonic\nCommercial Transport\", AIAA Paper 98\n0438, January 1998.\n3.\nTrottman, D.L., \"Wing in Ground Effect\nto the Rescue\", 1997\n4.\nCole, W., \"Big Bird\", Boeing Frontiers,\nSeptember 2002.\n5.\nBoeing 2002-2003 World Air Cargo\nForecast.\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics"

Properly positioned, each aircraft\ncould fly in the upwash field generated by neighboring\naircraft, effectively rotating the lift vector forward,\nreducing induced drag. It has been conjectured that\nthis drag reduction is one of the reasons that many\nmigratory bird species fly in closely spaced flocks [1].\nDetailed photographic measurements of Canadian\nGeese have found that the average lateral spacing\nbetween adjacent birds is very close to the optimum\npredicted by simple aerodynamic theory [2].\n*\nAerospace engineer, Associate Fellow AIAA\n**\nTechnical area leader, MemberAIAA\nThis paper is declared a work of the U.S. government and is\nnot subject to copyright protection in the United States.\nMost calculations of formation flight benefits are\nbased on a single horseshoe vortex representation of\nthe wing [1,3-6]. Maskew [7] performed extensive\ncalculation using a vortex lattice representation, and\nused a trim procedure which held lift constant with\nzero roll. Hummel has used both representations [4]\nand\nconducted\nlimited\niterative\nwake\nroll-up\ncalculations [8]. He also conducted two flight tests in\nan attempt to demonstrate a power saving under\nrealistic conditions. In his second test, a Dornier-228\nacted as a vortex generator for a following Dornier-28.\nUsing an automatic control system to maintain proper\nposition, an average power reduction of 10% was\nmeasured on the trail aircraft over a 150 sec. interval.\nThis paper will explore aspects of the problem not\nconsidered by prior investigators.\nSimplifications\nincluding constant specific fuel consumption and\nuniform aircraft weight across the formation will be\nrelaxed. Optimum flight conditions for a formation\nwill be developed.\nThe effect of accuracy in\nmaintaining lateral position and the effect of rotation\nof lead aircraft will also be studied. Aerodynamic\nmodeling will be done using the horseshoe vortex and\nvortex lattice methods. New horseshoe vortex results\nwill be presented using a velocity profile which\nincludes a viscous core.\nThroughout this paper, the term \"V formation\" will be\ntaken to be that used by birds, with the apex of the V\nin the direction of flight.\nDISCUSSION\nThe total induced drag of a formation of aircraft can be\nwritten in matrix form as:\nCL,2 -\n'CL,I\nCL,2\nCLJ\n(i)\n\nCopyright(c) 1998, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.\nwhere G is a symmetric matrix given as:\nO\\\nO~2\n---\nGj\n7?\n(7i\nTiAR\ni\n(2)\nThe terms in the G matrix are written in Prandtl's [9]\ncompact notation GI = (Ojk+CTkj)/2 where i=lj-kl. The\nmutual induced drag between a given pair of aircraft is\ngiven by the term GJ. The isolated effect of aircraft j\non aircraft k is given by the term ojk and vice versa.\nThese terms are a function of the relative spacing of\nthe aircraft only. For a single aircraft with an elliptic\nlift distribution, the self induced drag factor an is\nunity. For a given vertical and lateral spacing of\naircraft, the mutual induced drag between any pair of\naircraft Gjk+Cjk is independent of longitudinal spacing,\nalthough the individual values vary. This is Munk's\nstagger theorem [9].\nWritten in this fashion, the total\ninduced drag of a two aircraft system becomes:\n.2\nCDI -\n(3)\nxAR\n*AR\nnAR\nIdentical wings, physically joined have an aspect ratio\ndouble of the individual wings, giving <jj=-0.5.\nDETERMINATION OFc\nA variety of aerodynamic methods can be used to\ncompute the wake induced forces and moments. The\nhorseshoe vortex model [see Appendix] gives the off\ndiagonal terms in the G matrix as:\na^-Lini\n(4)\nThe spacing variables in eq. (4) are shown\nschematically in Figure 1.\nEq. (4) is shown\ngraphically in contour form in Figure 2.\nPositive\nvalues indicate a drag increase, and are evident when\nthe wings overlap to a great extent. Negative values\nindicate a drag reduction. The size of the beneficial\ndrag region decreases as vertical spacing increases.\nThe \"sweet spot\" of maximum drag reduction is very\nsmall, with a radius the order smaller than a tenth of a\nwing span.\nWingk\n(it/4)b\nri=Ay/b\nWingj\nFigure 1.

Fraction of Mutual Induced Drag Attained on\nDownstream Trail Wing, Horsehoe Vortex Model.\n\nCopyright(c) 1998, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.\nThe effect of spacing in the downstream direction is\nshown in Figure 2. This figure shows what fraction of\nthe total drag benefit is received by the trail wing.\nAlso shown on this figure are the lengths of three\nUSAF aircraft , non-dimensionalized by span.\nA\nreasonable operational safety requirement is to\ndisallow any lengthwise overlap between aircraft, i.e.\nrequire the nose of all aircraft to be behind the tail of\nthe aircraft upstream. This would allow all aircraft\nfreedom of movement in the spanwise direction\nwithout possibility of collision. Fig. 2 shows that this\nmeans at least two wing spans of downstream\nseparation are required for conventional aircraft. The\nall wing B-2 configuration is a unique case. At this\nspacing, 98.5 percent of the benefit is realized at the\ntrail aircraft.\nFor preliminary analyses then , it is\nreasonable to assume that all of the drag benefit is\naccrued on trail aircraft.\nEq. (4) result is singular for co-planar (^=0) wings if\nthe trailing vortices overlap (ri=0, ±rc/4). Kshatriya\nand Blake [5] represent this situation in an idealized\nform by assuming that the overlapping vortices cancel\nat the trail wing, leaving one tip vortex from each\nwing. This is equivalent to modeling a physically\njoined wing.\nSingularities can also be avoided by\nusing a vortex velocity profile that includes a viscous\ncore. The Rankine \"solid body\" profile is simple and\neasily integrated but yields multiple solutions\ndepending on the size and relative orientation of the\ncore and trailing wing tip. The Burnham-Hallock\nprofile [10] has been shown to correlate well with\nexperimental data, is easily integrated, and yields a\nsingle solution (see Appendix). The result obtained is\nsimilar in form to eq. (4):\n<7,=-L]n\n;+(77 + 7r/4)2\n(5)\nHere, (j. is the core radius, non-dimensionalized by\nwing span.\nMutual induced drag can also be calculated using\nvortex lattice or higher order codes. Results from the\nvortex lattice code HASC95 [11] are compared with\nthe horseshoe vortex model in Fig. 4. These two\nmethods represent the limiting cases in terms of\napproach. The horseshoe model assumes a single,\nfully rolled up vortex while the lattice model includes\nno roll-up. The HASC95 results are for two untapered\naspect ratio eight wings, one span apart in downstream\ndistance. Each wing was represented by 40 evenly\nspaced spanwise and 5 cosine spaced chordwise\nelements.\nThe maximum drag reduction from the\nvortex lattice method occurs at about 5% span overlap,\ncompared to the 22% span overlap for the horseshoe\nvortex method. The sharp change in the vortex lattice\nresult at the wing tip is inherent in the method [7]. A\ncore radius of 3% span has very little effect for most\nspacings and approximates the maximum reduction of\nai=-0.5 for physically joined wings.\n0.5 r-\nD)s\nQ\nT3\n-0.5\nVortex Lattice\nHorseshoe vortex, ji=0.03\nHorseshoe vortex, n=0 \\\n0.5\n1.5\nLateral Spacing Between Wing Centerlines, r\\\nFigure 4. Mutual Induced Drag (c?i) Predicted by Various\nMethods, £=0.\nLIFT DISTRIBUTION FOR MINIMUM DRAG\nWith total formation lift held constant, the distribution\nof lift across the formation which minimizes total\ninduced drag is found by differentiating eq. (2) in\nconjunction with Lagrange multipliers.\nThe result\nobtained is:\nCL,2\n(6)\nFor a two aircraft formation, equal lift (CL,I = CL^) is\nthe minimum drag solution. This is the biplane result\nand is one reason that negative relative incidence or\ndecalage is used on the forward wing of a staggered\nbiplane.\nFor a three aircraft formation, minimum induced drag\nis obtained when CL,j = CL,3 and:\n\nCopyright(c) 1998, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.\n(7)\nCz,,2 _\nO\\ --(72\nCL,1\nOi-l\nEq. (7) is Prantdl's result [9] for the minimum drag\nloading on a triplane with wings of equal size. In that\ncase, where adjacent wings are in each others\ndownwash, the interference is adverse and the center\nwing surface should carry less than 1/3 the total lift. In\nthe formation flight case, where interference is\nfavorable, the center wing should carry greater lift than\nits neighbors. Note that eq. (7) is independent of the\nformation orientation in the direction of flight. This\nmeans that the center wing should be heavier whether\nit is in the front of a V, the back of a reverse V, or the\nmiddle of an echelon. For a four aircraft formation,\nCL.I = CL,4, CL,2 = CLj3 and:\n:l+^^\n(8)\n= 1+-\nFor five aircraft, CL,I = CL,S , CL,2 = CL,4 and:\nCL,2 _l | (Q-i - 0-4 )(Ql ~ 1) +(02 ~ 03)(P! ~ 02)\nCL,\\ ~\n(o-l- 1X0-3 -l)-(<7i-<72)\"\n0-2(0-4-!)-<\n(9)\n- C72 Y\nIn all cases, the optimum lift distribution is such that\nthe wings at the end of the formation carry the least lift\nand the wings in the center carry the most.\nThe presence of one aircraft within a vortex generated\nby another will alter the vortex. This means that\naircraft further downstream will not \"see\" the same\nvortex, invalidating\nthe\nsuperposition\nprinciple\ninherent in eq. (6). Stewart [12] has investigated the\nvortex-trail aircraft interaction from the perspective of\nmodeling a wake vortex encounter.\nBy applying\nconservation of angular momentum to the vortex-trail\naircraft system, he treated the effect as an increase in\nthe vortex core radius as the trail aircraft encounters it.\nFor equal airplanes at his nominal condition, Stewart\nfound a 20 percent reduction in roll angle attained after\none second when this effect was included. For the\npresent analysis, this effect can be bounded by\nassuming that 100% of the vortex momentum is\nremoved by the first encountering aircraft. With this\nassumption, the optimum lift distribution for three\naircraft is:\nCL,\\\nFor four aircraft:\nCz-2\n-\n(10)\n(11)\n-PI)\n(12)\n(13)\nFor five aircraft:\nQ.,2 _\n<TI\nCL,1\nCL,3\nCL,I\nA plot of the lift variation for two, five and twelve\naircraft formations is shown in Fig. 5.

Distribution of Lift Within Formation for\nMinimum Induced Drag, T]=0.85, £=0.\nFig. 5 shows that total drag is minimized with an\nelliptical distribution of aircraft weight across the\nformation. The effect of ignoring the effect of vortices\non non-neighboring aircraft only changes the result for\nthe largest formation, where the optimum distribution\nis somewhat flatter. For large formations, the optimum\nlift distributions will not typically be attainable.\nHowever, the results can be used as a guide in\ndetermining an optimum formation layout and strategy\nfor rotating lead aircraft within a formation.\nOPTIMUM FLIGHT CONDITION\nThe specific range (distance flown per unit fuel\nexpended) of an aircraft formation can be written as:\n\nCopyright(c) 1998, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.\n(14)\nThis is often analyzed by assuming constant fuel\nconsumption (CT) with flight at a specified altitude or\nspeed.\nFor a formation of aircraft, maximizing\nspecific range results in flight at higher CL relative to a\nsingle aircraft. This can be achieved by flying at a\nhigher altitude or slower speed. In either case, the\ntotal drag and resultant power setting of aircraft within\nthe formation can be so small that variations in CTmust\nbe considered. Two cases will be examined, constant\nMach cruise and constant altitude cruise.\nConstant Mach Number\nFor a constant Mach cruise, with the level flight\nsubstitutions T=D and L=W, eq. (14) can be written\nas:\nS.R.= =2.\n(15)\nThe lift coefficient for maximum specific range can be\ncomputed using eqs. (1) and (15). For a two-aircraft\nformation, the result is:\n(16)\nCL,2 =\nFor larger formation sizes, the result is given in matrix\nform. If CT increases with reduced power setting, the\ntypical result, eq. (16) indicates that the optimum lift\ncoefficient is larger than if CT is assumed constant.\nConstant Altitude Cruise\n(\nc\nnARCDo\\l + -\nl\n<\nn CL,2\\(CL2 ( f f^\nQ.,i [[ Q,,i\n1,2}\nT,lJ\nVr,2\n-- *\nJcr,i\n^21\nFor a constant altitude cruise, eq. (14) becomes:\n(17)\nThe relationship for optimum lift with constant Mach\nand constant altitude cruises for a single aircraft is also\nobtained for the formation:\n/V3\n(18)\nalt'=const\nM=const\nM=const\nApplication of the foregoing relationships may result\nin one of the following results: the thrust required for\nthe lead aircraft exceeds the thrust available, or the\nthrust required for one of the following aircraft is less\nthan the minimum available (idle). These will require\neither a change in altitude or speed.\nMaximum Relative Range\nRelative range is defined as the ratio of the range of a\nformation relative to a single aircraft [7]. From an\naerodynamic perspective, relative range is obtained\nfrom the lift-to-drag ratio. Maximum induced drag\nreduction corresponds to the case of an equivalent\njoined wing. In this case, the effective aspect ratio of\neach aircraft in an n aircraft formation is n times the\naspect ratio of a single aircraft. If the formation flies\nat maximum UD (total induced drag = total parasite\ndrag), the maximum relative range is:\n°form\n\"single\n(19)\naero\nIf the formation is constrained to fly at the maximum\nUD point of a single aircraft, maximum relative range\nis greatly reduced, becoming:\nRform\nRsingle\n2n\nn +l\n(20)\naero\nWith this constraint, an infinite formation can only\ndouble the range of a single aircraft.\nFrom a propulsion system perspective, relative range\ncan be defined as the ratio of the fuel flow of a set of n\naircraft in single flight to the same set in formation\nflight (assuming velocity is the same). The minimum\npossible fuel flow in formation flight is taken to be all\ntrail aircraft at idle power with the lead aircraft cruise\npower. Maximum relative range in this case now\nbecomes:\nRform\nRsingle prop\n, FFjqie\nFF,\n(21)\ncruise\nThe fuel flow ratio for low bypass turbofans can be as\nhigh as one third at cruise altitude.\nPreferred Formation Geometry\nA symmetrical V formation results in light aircraft in\nthe center and heavy aircraft on the ends, which is the\nleast optimal from a lift distribution viewpoint. A\nreverse V formation is better, with the heavy aircraft in\nthe middle and light ones on the ends. However, this\n\nCopyright(c) 1998, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.\nformation has a lower relative range (propulsion\nlimited) due to two aircraft instead of one at the cruise\nfuel flow condition.\nAn echelon formation has\nsuccessively increasing aircraft weight further from the\nlead. However, if the lead aircraft rotates to the rear\nposition on a periodic basis, an elliptic weight\ndistribution can be simulated (Fig 6).\nAn echelon\ngeometry also allows freedom of movement in the\nspanwise direction without possibility of collision.\nThis is a distinct safety feature that both the V and\nreverse V lack.\nLead aircraft\nmoves to rear\nSecond aircraft\nbecomes new lead\nFigure 6. Echelon Formation Geometry.\nThe so-called \"equal power\" formation has received\nconsiderable attention [1,4].\nThis formation is\ndesigned to have equal drag benefit on all aircraft.\nTwo drawbacks to this formation are that significant\nlengthwise overlap is required, a safety hazard, and\nthat the lateral spacing is nowhere near optimal,\nmeaning that the drag equality is achieved by having\ntrail aircraft fly in suboptimal position.\nNUMERICAL EXAMPLE\nThis section will examine the effect of formation size,\nlateral position accuracy and rotation of lead aircraft\non relative range. No trim is included. A parabolic\ndrag\npolar\nis\nassumed\nand\nthe\neffects\nof\ncompressibility on both drag and engine performance\nare ignored. The formation geometry and lead aircraft\nrotation used are shown in Fig. 6. The analysis is run\nuntil one aircraft runs out of fuel, at which point the\nrange calculation stops.\nA constant Mach cruise\n(M=0.85) is assumed with aircraft increasing altitude\nas fuel is burned, subject to a thrust available\nconstraint.

(5) was used to generate values of CT\nusing (1=0.33.\nThe study vehicle is a lightweight fighter with the\nfollowing characteristics:\nWing area\nAspect Ratio\nGross Weight\nFuel Weight\nCdo\n300 sq ft\n25000 Ib\n7000 Ib\n0.020\nEngine characteristics (thrust and fuel flow as a\nfunction of Mach and altitude for various power\nsettings) were taken from the F-16D VISTA\nsimulation developed by McKeehen [13].\nLateral Position\nThe effect of accuracy in maintaining lateral position\non relative range is shown in Fig. 7. Three formation\nsizes are shown, with a maximum relative range of\nabout 2 attained for the 12 aircraft formation. For this\ncalculation, the aircraft lead was assumed to rotate\nevery ten minutes.

For an F-16, this translates to +/- 3 feet\nof position accuracy. As the position error increases,\ndecreases in relative range result as the trail aircraft\npass within the high downwash region for extended\nperiods.\n£- 2.2\nEo\n---\no\n\"ro\n= 1.8\n-2 1.6\nCO\n,0 1.4\nCD\nCOrr\n.1\nJS\nrS 0.8\n12 ship formation\n5 ship formation\n2 ship formation\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nLateral Accuracy of Aircraft Position, % span\nFigure 7.

This\nmeans that available angular acceleration will decrease\nwith span.\nRotation of Lead Aircraft\nThe effect of frequency of lead aircraft rotation on\nrelative range is shown in Fig. 8. Three formation\nsizes are again shown, with lateral position assumed to\nbe maintained within 0.05 span. Peaks correspond to\nconditions where all aircraft were low on fuel when\nthe first ran out, conversely, valleys correspond to\nconditions where some aircraft had a substantial fuel\nload remaining when the first ran out. The final peak\nrepresents the case where each aircraft was in the lead\nposition one time. The desired rotation frequency is\nproportional to the number of aircraft within the\nformation. A preferred operating condition may be to\nrotate position just often enough to avoid the large\nvalleys.\nFor the five aircraft formation, this\ncorresponds to about a 30 minute interval.\n*Z 2.2\nCO\nCO\n.52o>\n.£ 1.8\n.03\nI 1.6\nCO\n.2 1.4\nCDI-\nDC\n0.8\n12 ship formation\nFrequency of Aircraft Position Rotation, min\nFigure 8.

Also shown is the propulsion limit for a\ncruise/idle fuel flow ratio of one third, typical for low\nbypass engines at this flight condition.\nFor this\ncalculation, lateral position was assumed to be\nmaintained within 0.05 span, with the lead aircraft\nrotating at ten minute intervals. As more aircraft are\nadded, relative range increases up to a maximum of\nabout 1.8. As formation size in increased beyond five\nor six aircraft, the additional payoff is rapidly\ndiminished. For all formations larger than two aircraft,\nthe desired flight altitude could not be achieved due to\nthe thrust required on the lead aircraft exceeding the\nthrust available. For the five aircraft formation, the\ndesired initial cruise altitude was 53,900 ft, the\nmaximum attainable cruise altitude was 48,450 ft.\nThis raised an interesting question. Would relative\nrange increase if the lead aircraft used afterburner to\nincrease its attainable cruise altitude?.

The horseshoe model\ncan be used to estimate the rolling and yawing moment\nincrements induced on a trail wing, with the results\nobtained in the following form:\n/\nAR\nCLJ<-\n_Ti2\n(22)\n(23)\nNote that these relationships are for the wing only and\ndo not include any vertical tail effects, which can be\nsignificant, especially in side force and yaw.\nContours of the influence factor i\\i are shown in Fig.\n10.

For the conditions of high drag reduction (TJ\n= Tt/4), the trail aircraft has a tendency to roll and yaw\naway from its leader. The induced moments are stable\nwith lateral position for TJ > ?r/4.

Rolling/Yawing Moment Predicted by\nVarious Methods, £=0.\nThe above results are for a wing alone, different trends\ncould result for a complete configuration. A formation\nflight analysis of two F-18's using HASC95 has been\nmade which shows a larger yaw/roll moment ratio than\nthe wing alone result and a negative side force. The\nside force and most of the increased yaw was due to\nsuction forces on the vertical tails of the aft F-18.\nWake induced rolling and yawing moments of the\nsame sign mean a roll control device with proverse\nyaw would provide the best trim solution without\nexcessive rudder deflection. Differential all moving\ntails typically exhibit proverse yaw at low angles of\nattack and also provide a side force in the proper\ndirection. Use of these surfaces to trim the F-18 in roll\nand yaw resulted in a decrease in the induced drag\nbenefit of one third on the trail aircraft. Maskew [7]\nhas pointed out that roll trim using the proper wing\ncontrol surface can further reduce the induced drag on\nthe trail aircraft by making its wing lift distribution\nmore elliptical. Conventional ailerons exhibit adverse\nyaw, however, which would require additional rudder\nfor yaw and side force trim. A complete study of the\nvarious control surface options available is needed to\ndetermine the minimum \"trim drag\" condition.\nThe HASC95 F-18 results showed that the induced lift,\npitching moment and rolling moment on the trail\naircraft were effectively independent of the trail\naircraft angle of attack (CL) and were only functions of\nthe relative aircraft spacing (Ax, Ay, Az) and the lead\naircraft angle of attack (CL). The induced drag, side\nforce and yawing moment were found to be functions\nof the trail aircraft angle of attack as well as the other\nvariables.\nThese findings are consistent with the\nhorseshoe vortex results developed in the appendix,\nand suggest possible simplifications for developing\naerodynamic math models for simulation.\nCONCLUSION\nAnalysis of the induced drag effects of close formation\nflight has found:\na)\nLarge reductions in induced drag are possible.\nThese are accompanied by changes in lift, side force\nand moments about all three axes. Predictions of the\nmagnitude of these changes using horseshoe vortex\nand vortex lattice methods give similar trends with\ndifferences in the predicted lateral position of\nmaximum drag reduction.\n\nCopyright(c) 1998,American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.\nb)\nThe distribution of lift (aircraft weight) across\na formation which maximizes drag reduction is\nelliptical, with the heavier aircraft in the center and\nlighter aircraft on the ends. This formation can be\nmimicked in operation by using a single echelon with\nthe lead aircraft changing position to the rear on a\nperiodic basis. This formation is also desirable from a\nsafety standpoint.\nc)\nThe optimum cruise altitude of a formation is\nmuch higher than an equivalent single aircraft. The\nperformance of the propulsion system at these\nconditions (ability to attain required thrust for cruise,\ndecreased ratio of cruise thrust/idle thrust fuel flow,\nvariations in specific fuel consumption) reduces the\nattainable range increase.\nd)\nSimulations of the cruise leg of a constant\nMach ferry mission show that range increases of sixty\npercent are possible for a five aircraft formation\nrelative to a single aircraft. The ability to accurately\nmaintain lateral position is critical. Fifty percent of the\ndrag benefit is lost if the lateral/vertical position\ncannot be maintained to better than one tenth of a wing\nspan.\ne)\nTrim of the wake induced forces and moments\nmay further reduce the drag benefit.\nRoll control\ndevices that provide proverse yaw are desirable from\nthis viewpoint.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was conducted under a joint program of the\nAir Force Office of Scientific Research and the Air\nForce Research Laboratory.

Each wing's lift is\nrepresented as a single horseshoe vortex system, with\nthe bound vortex at the wing quarter chord (Fig 1).

The large size of intermodal\ncontainers, set by efficiency considerations for the\ntruck transport mode, presented some challenges in\ndetermining the most efficient way to carry large\nnumbers of containers in the BWB. Several BWB\nfreighter configurations with different arrangements for\ncarrying containers were analyzed and optimized with\nthe Wing Multidisciplinary Optimization Design\n(WingMOD) code. Airport pavement loading and 80-\nmeter box constraints ultimately limited the size of the\nBWB freighter. Measuring efficiency as the weight of\nfreight carried divided by aircraft takeoff weight, a\nlarge, dedicated BWB freighter was shown to offer\nsignificant improvements in efficiency that could be\nused to develop new opportunities for the air cargo\nbusiness.\nIntroduction\nThe Blended-Wing-Body (BWB) concept has been\nstudied for its potential to provide improved efficiency\nfor commercial passenger and military operations\n(Refs. 1-2). Weight and fuel burn reductions provided\nby the BWB lead to lower operating cost. The same\nefficiency improvements could be used for reducing the\ncost of airborne freight delivery. Since approximately\n1% of transoceanic freight is currently carried by air,\nsignificant reductions in airborne freight costs could\nallow aircraft to compete against ships for a portion of\nthe remaining 99% of the shipping market, opening a\nvery large market for freighter aircraft (Ref. 3).\n\n* Engineer/Scientist, Phantom Works, Senior Member\nAIAA\n+ Engineer/Scientist, Phantom Works, Member AIAA\n++ Senior\nSpecialist Program Manager, Integrated\nDefense Systems, Member AIAA\nCopyright (c) 2003 by The Boeing Company. Published\nby the American Institute of Aeronautics and\nAstronautics, Inc. with permission.\nSince airborne transport is only part of the system for\nshipping freight, maximizing cost reductions requires\nconsideration of the other pieces, particularly the cost\nof ground transport and the cost of transferring freight\nbetween air and ground modes. To become\ncompetitive with ship-borne freight, it is necessary to\nemulate the capability provided by International\nOrganization for Standardization (ISO) standard\ncontainers, which are carried on both ships and trucks\nand can be transferred as a unit between modes.\nCurrent containers for air cargo are not suited for\nefficient truck transport, meaning the airborne freight is\ntypically unloaded from air cargo containers and\nrepacked into ground transport containers. While the\nsize and weight of ISO containers are too large to be\nefficient for use on aircraft, a lighter and somewhat\nsmaller container could be efficient for truck transport\nand still be accommodated on aircraft. By designing\nthe aircraft to carry these intermodal containers,\nsignificant cost savings can be achieved from avoiding\nthe transfer between air and ground containers.\nSince larger aircraft tend to be more efficient, the\ngreatest cost reduction should come from a very large\nfreighter. This size-driven efficiency should reduce the\nfuel burned per pound of cargo delivered. It should\nalso reduce aircraft takeoff weight per pound of cargo.\nIn addition, costs that are fixed per trip get distributed\nover a larger payload. Costs that are fixed per trip or\ndriven by weight, such as crew pay and landing fees,\nget better per pound of cargo as an aircraft gets bigger\nto accommodate increased payload.\nBy using intermodal containers, carrying many\ncontainers on a very large aircraft, and exploiting the\nefficiency of the BWB, large reductions in cost for\nairborne freight should be possible. To explore this\npotential, a study was conducted by Boeing Phantom\nWorks to configure and evaluate the performance of a\nlarge BWB freighter capable of carrying intermodal\ncontainers.\nThis study first looked at different arrangements for\ncarrying large numbers of intermodal containers on the\n\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nBWB. The Wing Multidisciplinary Optimization\nDesign (WingMOD) code was used to optimize several\nBWB configurations, each designed around the\ndimensions needed to enclose and carry a different\ncargo arrangement. By determining the best\nperformance possible with each cargo arrangement,\nWingMOD would provide very useful information for\nselecting the best cargo arrangement for reducing cost.\nDuring the study, efficiency was used to indicate\ndifferences in cost between configurations. Here,\nproductivity is defined as the payload weight times the\ndesign range times the aircraft Mach number.\nEfficiency is defined as the productivity divided by the\naircraft takeoff weight. An aircraft is more productive\nif it can carry more payload farther and faster. It is\nmore efficient if it can be as productive with a lower\ntakeoff weight. Since cost correlates strongly with\ntakeoff weight, efficiency approximates how much\npayload can be sent a given distance for a given cost.\nUsing efficiency as the metric for comparison, a\nfreighter\nconfiguration\nwas\nselected\nfrom\nthe\nWingMOD study and was examined in greater detail to\nverify its airport compatibility and its ability to load\nintermodal containers. The resulting BWB freighter\nappears to be viable while providing significant\nimprovements in efficiency over existing freighters.\nApproach\nRequirements\nTo perform the study, notional requirements were\ndeveloped for intermodal container carriage, airport\ncompatibility, and performance. These requirements\nwould guide the aircraft configuration to a fairly\nrealistic and practical freighter design.\nThe freighter was designed to carry a maximum\nnumber of intermodal containers. These containers\nwere dimensioned to be practical and efficient for truck\ntransport so that the entire container could be\ntransferred from aircraft to truck, avoiding the ground\nhandling cost of unpacking and re-packing the cargo.\nThe containers were 96 in wide, 156 in long, and 108 in\ntall. These dimensions were roughly optimized for\nground transport with some consideration for airplane\ncarriage. The width is the same as existing ISO\ncontainers. The length is shorter than ISO containers, a\nfeature that allows the intermodal container to fit\nthrough aircraft cargo doors. The height is greater than\nISO containers, which recovers some of the volume lost\nby the reduced length while still allowing the container\nto fit under highway overpasses during truck transport.\nWhile the freighter was designed to carry as many\ncontainers as possible to reduce cost through economies\nof scale, it was required to operate out of existing\nairports. The possibility of operating the freighter from\na few airfields dedicated to the low-cost freight\noperation was considered. To achieve reduced-cost\nfreight service, it made sense to operate out of low-\nutilization remote airfields instead of high-utilization\nairports serving urban areas, especially when trucks\nwould be used to move the freight over moderately\nlong distances to its final destination. These remote\nairfields could be designed specifically to handle the\nfreighter, allowing the aircraft to be sized to carry more\ncontainers. One consideration that drove the\nrequirement to fit existing airports was the potential to\nsell additional aircraft for freight and commercial\nservice, which could lower the cost of producing the\nfreighters. Another consideration was that retaining\ncompatibility with existing airports also provides\noptions for alternate landing sites for emergency\nsituations and weather. For compatibility with Group\nVI airports, a wing span less than 80 meters was\nrequired. The freighter weight was also constrained\nunder 1.3 million pounds, a weight similar to an A-380\nfreighter, to satisfy pavement loading requirements.\nTo fit typical air cargo operations, it was desired that\nthis new freighter be able to complete a 4,200 nm round\ntrip in 24 hours. This capability enables an operator to\nprovide daily service in both directions with a single\nairplane, reducing the required fleet size. It allows the\nairplane to be based in a single location, reducing\nbasing cost. It also simplifies crew scheduling and\nreduces flying time to reduce crew cost. To achieve the\n24 hour, 4,200 nm round trip, study requirements were\nset for a 0.85 Mach aircraft with sufficient doors to\nminimize the turn time from loading and unloading\ncontainers.\nBlended-Wing-Body Efficiency\nBased on efficiency shown in previous studies (Refs. 1-\n2), a BWB configuration was studied as a way to meet\nthe low cost freighter requirements. Aerodynamically,\nthe BWB has less wetted area than a conventional\nconfiguration, resulting in reduced drag (Fig. 1).\nStructurally, the BWB benefits from being more span-\nloaded than conventional configurations, with weight\ndistributed along the wing where it cancels lift to\nreduce the bending loads that increase structural weight\n(Fig. 1). The BWB takes a structural penalty for\ncarrying pressure loads with a flat-sided pressure\nvessel, but it benefits from having the fuselage pressure\nvessel integrated with the wing box such that it carries\nwing bending in addition to pressure loads. The depth\nprovided by the fuselage makes it efficient for carrying\nwing-bending loads and the fuselage weight increase\nfor the flat-sided pressure vessel is offset by a reduction\nin wing weight. The result of these aerodynamic and\nstructural benefits is a BWB configuration that is\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nlighter and more fuel-efficient than a conventional\nconfiguration with equivalent payload-range capability.\nWhile the BWB efficiency advantage is attractive, the\ntechnology for the flying-wing control system and low-\ncost composites that enable the concept require\nadditional development. This study explored what\ncapabilities the BWB could provide once those\ntechnologies are developed.\nOptimization Method\nTo rapidly explore the design space for these large\nBWB\nfreighters,\nthe\nWingMOD\nconfiguration\noptimization tool was used. WingMOD is a tool for\noptimizing transport aircraft wings and tails that has\nbeen extended to optimize aspects covering most of a\nBWB configuration (Refs. 4-7). WingMOD typically\nminimizes takeoff weight through optimizing wing\nplanform shape and other characteristics while\nobserving hundreds of constraints evaluated from\nanalysis of dozens of design conditions. During an\noptimization, wing chord and thickness are sized to\nwrap around the payload. Chord lengths along the span\nare set by trades between reducing area for reduced\ndrag\nand\nincreasing\narea\nfor\nlow-speed\nlift\nrequirements. Trades between drag and structural\nweight set outer wing twist and thickness. The\nconfiguration is trimmed by adjusting control surface\ndeflections through all flight conditions. Balance is\nassessed and the distribution of wing fuel is optimized\nto manage the center of gravity. Conditions where\ncontrol power is critical are evaluated to determine the\nstability limits. The result of the optimization is an\naircraft configuration that meets many real constraints\nthat are not usually captured in conceptual design.\nThus, the resulting configuration can be considered a\nclosed design. The ability of the WingMOD optimizer\nto handle many design variables allows it to push the\nconfiguration up against many constraints to achieve\nthe lowest weight solution.\n\nFig. 1 BWB aerodynamic and structural efficiency.\nResults\nCargo Arrangement\nSince packaging the largest number of containers in the\nfreighter would lead to the highest efficiency, initial\nstudies focused on finding the best arrangement of\nintermodal containers. Options for laying out the cross\nsection of the cargo bay were studied first. These\noptions are depicted in. The cross section used for a\npassenger-carrying BWB is too short to carry\nintermodal containers. Carrying containers with the\nlong side running fore and aft creates the tightest-fitting\ncross section. This arrangement results in 106 inches\nbetween rib centers, with 2 inches of space on the sides\nof the container and 6-inch thick ribs, including\nstructure and coverings. Placing the intermodal\ncontainer with the long side going across the cargo bay\nresults in a 116-inch wide bay with 2 inches of\nclearance around the container.\nThe diagonal Y-bracings at the upper corners of the\ncargo bay shorten the distance that the upper skin panel\nmust carry pressurization loads, reducing bending\nmoments on the panel. On the passenger version, the\nnominal unsupported span between Y-braces is 77\ninches. This span was maintained in the container-\ncarrying variants by adjusting the skin panel position\nrelative to the braces while moving the braces upward\nto clear the containers. With the long side of the\ncontainer running fore and aft, the cargo bay is\nnarrower than the passenger version, allowing short\nbraces to produce the required unsupported span. With\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFig. 2 BWB freighter cross-sections.\nthe long side of the container running sideways across\nthe bay, long braces are needed to produce the required\nunsupported span. The longer braces create a\nsignificant amount of unused space above the\ncontainer. The increase in body thickness due to the\nunused space was expected to have adverse effects on\naerodynamic performance. Orienting the containers\nwith the long side running longitudinally resulted in\nvery little empty space, so that orientation was selected.\nAfter selecting the cargo bay cross-section, trade\nstudies were performed on the arrangement of cargo\ncontainers. Since the BWB external geometry results\nfrom wrapping the cargo, varying cargo arrangement\nwas expected to result in significant performance\ndifferences. Several BWB configurations were\noptimized for different cargo arrangements using\nWingMOD. The productivity and efficiency of these\nconfigurations were compared.\nFig. 3 shows the results of the cargo arrangement study.\nDifferent cargo arrangements are sketched with the\nnumber of intermodal containers carried by each\narrangement indicated next to each sketch. A large\nBWB designed for passenger use and modified to\naccommodate\nintermodal\ncontainers\ncarries\nintermodal containers plus 28 special containers packed\ninto the rear and the very front. These special\ncontainers are 96 in wide, 125 in long, and 80 in tall.\nThey have the same footprint as AMJ containers used\non MD-11 freighters but are shorter. While such an\nairplane would benefit from commonality with the\npassenger variant, the number of intermodal containers\nit carries is relatively low. Two configurations\ndesigned for 44 and 50 intermodal containers on a\nsingle deck are more productive and efficient than the\npassenger derivative freighter. Putting intermodal\ncontainers on two decks can produce more efficient and\nproductive configurations, with the lower deck\ncontainers located around the middle of the cargo bay.\nThe configurations with 46, 58, and 68 containers\ntrended toward increasing efficiency with increasing\npayload. The configurations with 64 and 70 containers\nlooked at variations in planform geometry. The 64-\ncontainer configuration looked at increased leading\nedge sweep in the cargo bay; the 70-container\nconfiguration looked at lengthening the cargo bay.\nBoth of these variations did worse than the trend set by\nthe other double-deck configurations. The double-deck\n58- and 68-container arrangements had the best\nefficiency and were selected for additional study.\nWhile the 68-container freighter had the highest\nefficiency at this point, it was slightly over the 1.3\nmillion pound limit chosen to ensure airport pavement\nloading compatibility, so the 58-container freighter was\ncarried along as a risk-reducing alternative.\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFig. 3 Cargo arrangement trade study.\n\nFig. 4 Cargo density trade study.\nCargo Density\nIt was observed that the containers were adding a lot of\nvolume and wetted area to the aircraft and that packing\ncontainers more densely would reduce the volume\nneeded and restore some aerodynamic efficiency. It\nwas further noted that pursuing ship-borne freight was\nlikely to result in higher-density payloads than typically\ncarried by air. To examine this effect, higher-density\npayloads were studied, with densities of 11 lb/ft3\ninstead of the 7.65 lb/ft3 baselined in the study. These\nconfigurations are shown in Fig. 4 compared with the\nbest configurations with 7.65-lb/ft3 density. While the\nhigh-density configurations with 52 and 58 containers\nexceeded the 1.3 million pound limit, the high-density\n46-container configuration was under the limit and had\nthe best efficiency. The 58-container high-density\nconfiguration actually had worse efficiency than the\nhigh-density\n46-container\nconfiguration,\nprobably\nbecause limitations on parameters such as span were\nhurting performance at these high weights. These\nresults suggest some attention should be paid to getting\nthe correct cargo density: underestimating the density\nwould result in an aircraft that is penalized by being\nunable to fully use its volume. The high-density 46-\ncontainer configuration was carried along with the\nbasic 58- and 68-container configurations for additional\nstudy.\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n1.20\n1.25\n1.30\n1.35\n1.40\nSpan (ft)\nTOW (M illion lb)\n80 meter\n2 bay widths\n\nFig. 5 Span trade study.\nSpan\nAlthough the 68-container freighter was essentially at\nthe 80-meter span limit, a study was conducted to see\nwhat improvement could be gained by exceeding the\nlimit. Fig. 5 shows the result of optimizing\nconfigurations for increasing span. An improvement is\nseen for just exceeding the span limit. Further\nincreases in span do not yield additional improvement.\nThis result suggests the aircraft is nearly at its optimal\nspan and that the small penalty for staying within the\n80-meter limit is probably worth the benefits of greater\noperational flexibility.\nRefined Configurations\nFrom the initial studies, three container arrangements\nwere selected based on their high efficiency and ability\nto meet the airport compatibility weight limit. The\ninitial studies also led to a decision to keep span within\nthe 80-meter box, based on the small weight penalty\nbeing worth the operational flexibility.\nDuring the initial studies, it was observed that allowing\nthe gear to move further aft relative to the aft limit\ncould improve the designs. This degree of freedom\nwas added to the optimization procedure and the three\nselected configurations were re-optimized. The refined\nconfigurations appear in Fig. 6.\nEach configuration was optimized to a range of\n5,000 nm at its design payload. While 4,200-nm range\nis more typically flown for air cargo, 5,000 nm\nprovides flexibility to fly further or to make 4,200 nm\nwith increased cargo density. Each aircraft was\nconstrained to an approach speed no greater than\n150 kn at its maximum payload. Basic payload\ndensities for the 68- and 58-container configurations\nwere 7.65 lb/ft3 for the design mission and 9 lb/ft3 for\nthe maximum payload mission. The payload densities\nfor the high-density 46-container configuration were\n11 lb/ft3 for the design mission and 12 lb/ft3 for the\nmaximum payload mission. While the 10-bay, 68-\ncontainer configuration exceeded the 1.3 million pound\nlimit in the initial study, it ended up within the limit\nafter refinement.\nFig. 7 compares the efficiency of the three\nconfigurations as a function of payload density. For\nconfigurations compared at the same range and Mach\nnumber, productivity is proportional to the payload\nweight carried and efficiency is proportional to payload\nweight divided by takeoff weight.\nDesign points at 5,000 nm are shown in open symbols.\nThe high-density 46-container configuration has the\nhighest efficiency of the design points.\nThe variation in efficiency with payload density at\n4,200 nm is shown with the solid symbols and lines.\nThe 58- and 68-container configurations do not make\n4,200 nm with maximum payload density. The 58-\ncontainer configuration can carry 8.70 lb/ft3 at 4,200\nnm; the 68-container configuration can carry 8.66 lb/ft3.\nThe aircraft are more efficient at the higher densities.\nThe 46-container high-density configuration can fly\n4,200 nm at its maximum payload density of 12 lb/ft3.\nThe 46-container configuration has better efficiency at\nhigh\ndensity\nthan\nthe\n58-\nand\n68-container\nconfigurations; however, it has worse efficiency at the\nbasic 7.65 lb/ft3 density.\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nWhile the 46-container configuration offers the\nflexibility of carrying denser payloads and the potential\nfor more efficiency at high density, it was decided that\ngetting the best efficiency at the basic density was more\nimportant. The 68-container configuration was selected\nfor further study based on having the highest efficiency\nat the 7.65-lb/ft3 density.\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\nFinal Configuration\nFollowing its development in WingMOD, the 10-bay,\n68-container configuration was modeled in the\nUnigraphics computer aided design (CAD) program.\nThis step would help verify the container capacity and\nthe ability to load the containers in the aircraft.\nThe resulting aircraft is shown in Fig. 8. This freighter,\nnamed the BWB-8-1000, has a main deck that spans 10\ncargo bays. The six center-bays are deep enough for a\nlower deck capable of carrying intermodal containers.\nThe freighter accommodates 50 intermodal containers\non the main deck and 18 on the lower deck.\nAn interior arrangement of the freighter is shown in\nFig. 9. Cargo door openings are shown and a method\nfor loading containers on the upper deck is indicated.\nContainers would pass through openings in the\nstructural ribs to move between bays.\n\n10 Bay\n8 Bay\n8 Bay\nHigh Density\nTOW (lb)\n1,253,000\n1,106,000\n1,120,000\nOEW (lb)\n492,000\n449,000\n418,000\nDesign Payload (lb)\n390,000\n333,000\n379,500\nMax Payload (lb)\n459,000\n391,500\n414,000\nDes./Max Density (lb/ft3)\n7.65 / 9.00\n7.65 / 9.00\n11.00 / 12.00\nContainers\n\nFig. 6 Refined cargo and density trade configurations.\n1.1M\nTOGW = 0.9M\n1.3M\n1.5M\n7.65\n8.66\n12.00\n9.00\n11.00\n7.65\nProductivity (Million lb x nmi)\nEfficiency (Prod/TOW) (nmi)\n10 bay (68 cont.)\n8 bay (58 cont.)\n8 bay high density (46 cont.)\nDesign points @ 5000 nm\n\nFig. 7 Fixed-planform cargo density trades at 4,200 nm range.\nThe concept for loading containers is illustrated in Fig.\n10.

The payload-range capability of the BWB-\n8-1000 is shown in Fig. 11. The more-detailed CASES\nevaluation resulted in a higher takeoff weight than\npredicted in WingMOD. Although this weight was\nslightly over the 1.3 million pound limit set for this\nstudy, it was considered close enough that a solution\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nfor pavement loading would be worked out. The\npayload-range for an A-380 freighter is shown for\ncomparison. The increase in payload and range offered\nby the BWB is apparent in the figure. The A-380\ncannot actually carry the intermodal containers\naccommodated by this BWB, and its payload-range\nshown in the figure is based on more conventional air\ncargo containers. The BWB also offers the capability\nto load up with denser cargo than the A-380.\nThe efficiency and productivity of the BWB-8-1000 is\nplotted in Fig. 12. Compared against existing large\nfreighters, the BWB-8-1000 is up to 44% more\nefficient. This efficiency gain can help reduce cost, but\nachieving maximum cost reductions is dependent on\ncombining this efficiency with productivity gains from\nincreased payload capacity and ground handling\nreductions from carrying intermodal containers. These\nimprovements are captured in the large BWB freighter\nand open the potential for expanding the market for\nairborne freight.\nConclusion\nA study was conducted to design a BWB freighter to\nachieve significant efficiency improvements aimed at\nreducing the cost of delivering airborne freight. A\nBWB freighter design was developed to carry a large\nnumber of intermodal containers. This design was\nultimately\nlimited\nby\nairport\ncompatibility\nconsiderations, with a span near the 80-meter limit and\na maximum takeoff weight around 1.3 million pounds\nto allow acceptable pavement loading.

The project's primary goal is to\ninvestigate potential benefits of flying aircraft in the aerodynamic wake vortex emanating\nfrom a lead aircraft's wing tip. Initial analytic studies predict that a trailing aircraft may\nexperience drag reductions of 10% or more by gaining additional lift in the updraft portion of\nthe lead's wake vortex. The technical challenge is to be able to find the optimal position\nwithin the vortex to fly, then hold that position consistently in what is an extremely turbulent\nflow field. We know that pilots have been able to do this in the past, but the task involves a\nvery high workload.\nThe Autonomous Formation Flight system marries an extremely robust flight control and\nguidance system with a close-coupled GPS/IMU placed on two F-18s. Inter-ship\ncommunication allows the multiple GPS/IMU systems to share state data and through and\nextended Kalman filter technique, they yield a differential carrier phase solution. They\nresolve the relative position accuracy between the aircraft in formation to less than 10 cm.\nThrough shared state data, the guidance systems aboard both F-18s resolve coordinated\ntrajectories that permit the aircraft to maintain formation. The trailing aircraft is thus capable\nof maintaining its position within the lead aircraft's wing tip vortex with extremely high\naccuracy.\nThe implications and applications of this technology are far reaching, not just for fuel\neconomy but for other future applications such as aerial refueling, aircraft logistics, air traffic\ncontrol, and carrier landing systems.\nPage 2\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\n\nSpecial Acknowledgements & References To Technical Papers\nJake Vachon (NASA TM 2003-2107341)\nRonald Ray (NASA TM 2003-2107341)\nKevin Walsh (NASA TM 2003-2107341)\nKimberly Ennix (NASA TM 2003-2107341)\nRon Ray (NASA TM 2002 210723)\nBrent Cobleigh (NASA TM 2002 210723)\nJake Vachon (NASA TM 2002 210723)\nClint St. John (NASA TM 2002 210723)\nEugene Lavretsky (AIAA-2002-4757)\nGlenn Beaver (NASA TM-2002-210728)\nPeter Urschel (NASA TM-2002-210728)\nCurtis E.

The figure above illustrates this concept showing how the baseline (non-formation flight) lift and drag values, L and D, rotate by the change in angle of attack, 'I, due to the upwash effect\nwhile in the vortex flowfield.\nBecause of traditional bookkeeping methodology, the actual lift and drag values are maintained relative to the vehicle's global, rather than local, flight path during formation flight. The term, 'D, is\nused to represent the drag change due to the rotation of the lift force from L to L'. The drag during formation flight, DFF, is obtained by:\nDFF = D' cos('I) -'D\nwhere: 'D = sin('I) L\nIn a similar manner the term 'L, is used to represent the lift change due to the rotation of the drag force from D to D'. The lift during formation flight, DFF, is obtained by:\nLFF = L' cos('I) + 'L\nwhere:'L = sin('I) D\nBecause lift tends to be an order of magnitude greater than drag (L>>D), drag is influenced significantly more by the rotation effect than lift is. A considerable reduction in drag can be realized by a\nsmall upwash angle, while an insignificant increase in lift occurs.\n\nF-18 Wing Vortices & Cross Flow Gradient\n3-View, F/A-18E: Mach 0.85, AOA 3deg\nPage 13\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\n0.00\n-0.25\n-0.50\nContours of\nPressure Coeff (Cp)\nCFD Results: Courtesy of Dave Stookesberry, Boeing STL.\nTrailing Aircraft In This Wake Experience\nAn Asymmetric, Turbulent Flow Field\n\nPage 14\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\nVortex Influence on Induced Drag\n*Adapted from: Blake and Multhopp, AIAA-98-4343, August 1998\nPredicted induced drag change using\ngeneric horseshoe vortex model*\nCalculated induced drag change\nobtained from flight data, with\nsimilar results at ALL flight conditions!\nPercent Induced drag change, M=0.56, 25,000 ft, 55 ft N2T\n-40\n-25\n-12\n0%\n-0.5\n0.5\n0.4\n-0.4\nVertical Separation (Z), wingspans\nLateral Separation (Y), wingspans\n-4\n-4\nLateral Separation (Y), wingspans\n-0.5\n0%\n-4\n-12\n-25\n-50\n-0.4\n0.4\nVertical Separation (Z), wingspans\n0.5\nLateral Separation (Y), wingspans\n-\n0%\n-4\n-12\n-25\n-50\n-0.4\n0.4\nRapid Drag Increase\nLarger \"sweet spot\"\nFlight Test\nTheoretical\nHammer home that this is INDUCED drag!\nThe flight results also measure higher drag increases inboard than predicted, but this is also the region where data quality is worse because the points are more difficult to fly. Some of these points\nwere very unstable as the vortex seemed to impinge on the tail or other surfaces causing the trailing aircraft to continually wander from the target position. Higher trim drag effects could\nalso contribute to the large drag increases. The line of zero benefit is also located further outboard than predicted. These results indicate substantially higher sensitivity to lateral positioning\ninboard of the sweet spot than predicted. Small changes in lateral positioning in this region can result in large changes in benefits (drag increase!). The overall vertical sensitivity\nis less than predicted; the overall shape of the region of most benefit is more round than oval as predicted for a generic wing. Induced drag results are similar at all flight\nconditions and separation distances:\nThe induced drag change measured at the transport flight condition (not presented) correlated very well to those obtained at the reference condition shown above in both shape and magnitude. This\nis a significant result indicating an accurate model of induced drag change could potentially be used to model drag benefits at other conditions.\n\nF-18A Wake Vortex Characteristic Aero-Increments Vary\nGreatly With Offset Distance 'Y Between A/C\nPage 15\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\nInduced Pitching Moment (I 0)\n-0.04\n-0.03\n-0.02\n-0.01\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n0.04\n0.05\n+280\n+240\n+200\n+160\n+120\n+080\n+040\n+020\n+010\n+005\n+000\n-005\n-010\n-020\n-040\n-080\n-120\n-160\n-200\n-240\n-280\n'Cm\n'Y\n'Z\nInduced Yawing Moment (I 0)\n-0.008\n-0.006\n-0.004\n-0.002\n0.000\n0.002\n0.004\n0.006\n0.008\n0.010\n0.012\n+280\n+240\n+200\n+160\n+120\n+080\n+040\n+020\n+010\n+005\n+000\n-005\n-010\n-020\n-040\n-080\n-120\n-160\n-200\n-240\n-280\n'Cn\n'Y\n'Z\nInduced Rolling Moment (I 0)\n-0.05\n-0.04\n-0.03\n-0.02\n-0.01\n0.00\n0.01\n0.02\n0.03\n+280\n+240\n+200\n+160\n+120\n+080\n+040\n+020\n+010\n+005\n+000\n-005\n-010\n-020\n-040\n-080\n-120\n-160\n-200\n-240\n-280\n'Cl\n'Y\n'Z\nDrag Reduction (I 0)\n0.00\n0.50\n1.00\n1.50\n2.00\n2.50\n3.00\n+280\n+240\n+200\n+160\n+120\n+080\n+040\n+020\n+010\n+005\n+000\n-005\n-010\n-020\n-040\n-080\n-120\n-160\n-200\n-240\n-280\n'Y\nCD form / CD\n'Z\nOptimal, Min Drag Near\nPoint Where Wingtips Align\nLinear Panel Method Results\n\nAFF Research Aircraft\nAFF Research Aircraft\n- Pre-Production TF-18A (2 Seater)\n- Research Modifications\n- Instrumentation/Telemetry System\n- Independent Separation Measurement System\n- Formation Flight Control System & Instrumentation\nSystem\n- Production Support Flight Control Computers\n- Engines Modified with Flight Test Instrumentation\nPackage for Thrust Measurement\n- Cockpit Highly Adaptable Research Monitor System\n- HUD Video & Hot Microphone System\nNASA 845 Systems Research Aircraft (SRA)\nNASA 847\n- Production F-18A (1 Seater)\n- Research Modifications\n- Instrumentation/Telemetry System\n- Independent Separation Measurement System\n- Formation Flight Control System & Instrumentation\nSystem\n- Production Support Flight Control Computers\n- HUD Video & Hot Microphone System\nTwo NASA F-18 aircraft were used for this research.

      "content": "Overview of Experiment\n-\nFlight Conditions\n- M = 0.56, 25000 feet\n(Subsonic condition)\n- M = 0.86, 36000 feet\n(Transonic condition)\n-\nNose-To-Tail (N2T)\nDistances\n- 20, 55, 110 and 190 feet\n-\nNomenclature\n- X-direction (longitudinal)\n- Y-direction (lateral)\n- Z-direction (vertical)\nThe subsonic flight condition (M=0.56, h=25000 feet) was selected to match pre-existing data from vortex-effect prediction codes. These codes needed to be validated to determine their utility on\nfuture applications of AFF. Since a possible future application of AFF is for transport airplane, flight data were also acquired at M=0.86 and h =36000 feet. This transonic flight condition is\nrepresentative for that class of vehicle.\nThe vortex effects were also mapped at different longitudinal distances behind the leader airplane. These Nose-To-Tail (N2T) distances were monitored by the control room and maintained by the\npilots through periodic radio calls. Only the results from the subsonic condition, 55' N2T will be presented here. 55' is equal to the length of the F/A-18.\nThe reference axis system was as shown above. It should be noted that although Z is positive down, this presentation will refer to positions above the lead airplane (or high) as positive and positions\nbelow the lead airplane (or low) as negative.\nPage 1\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\n\nPage 2\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\nLift and Drag Analysis\nFlight Test Database\nEngine Data\nAir Data\nINS Data\nIn-Flight Thrust Model\nFG, FRAM, FEDRAG\nWind Axis Accelerations\nAXW, AYW, AZW\nAir Data Computations\nGross Weight, Vinf, Po\nDest. = TTrail.- JLead\nPerformance Model\nD = cos(Dest) FG - FRAM - FEDRAG - FEX\nCL, CD , CDi = CD- CD0\nVortex Effect = Vortex - Baseline\n%'CD, %'CDi, %'WFT\nPredicted Performance\n(outside vortex influence)\nCL, CD , CD0\nFEX=GW*AXW\nPerformance data was determined using classical techniques. A force balance along the flight path was used to determine drag while a force balance perpendicular to that was used to determine lift:\nD = cos(Dest) FG - FRAM - FEDRAG-(GW*AXW); L = sin(Dest) FG + (GW*NXW). Three primary data reduction areas feed the performance mode; 1) Air Data, 2) IFT, and 3) Accelerations.\nThe Air Data model computes gross weight (GW) using empty weight and the remaining total fuel accounting for crew weight. It also includes a calculation of an estimated alpha, Dest, which is based\non the trailing aircraft's pitch angle and the lead aircraft's flight path angle (Dest = qtrail-Jlead). This was required because the trailing aircraft's alpha probes are unusable during formation\nflight due to localized upwash influences of the lead aircraft. Because the lead aircraft flew at steady-state conditions (constant speed and altitude), the flight path angle, Jlead, was always close\nto zero.\nThe engine manufacturer's IFT model was used to calculate thrust on the F404-GE-400 engines installed in the trailing F/A-18 Aircraft. The next chart describes the measurements used to run this\nmodel. The model calculated gross thrust (FG), ram drag (FRAM) and engine throttle dependent drag, (FEDRAG). Gross thrust is the primary force the engine produces out the tail pipe, FRAM\nrepresents the force loss due to the momentum of air, W1, entering the inlet, and FEDRAG accounts for the external drag forces associated with the engine nozzle and inlet spillage flow.\nThe INS was used to obtain vehicle acceleration data. This data was corrected for rotation effects due to not being mounted exactly on the center of gravity. It then was translated into the flight path\n(wind axis) coordinate system. Axial acceleration was used to compute vehicle excess thrust: FEX = GW*AXW\nThe performance model used the information from the three paths described above to obtain lift, drag and respective coefficients. To obtain drag reduction values, data obtained during formation\nflight (vortex) was compared to baseline (non-vortex) points completed in a back-to-back fashion. Some formation flight test points did not include a slide-out maneuver to obtain baseline conditions.\nFor these few points, baseline data were estimated based on data trends in drag related to gross weight. A simple prediction model was used to calculate baseline lift and drag values to evaluate the\nreasonableness of the baseline data.\n\nTest Point Procedure\n-\nPilot Procedure\n- Acquire and hold position within the influence of the vortex for\n30 seconds of stable data\n- Engage auto-throttle velocity-hold and maintain position for\n20 seconds of stable data\n- Laterally slide out of position (away from lead a/c), engage\naltitude-hold and stabilize outside of vortex for 20 seconds\n-\nTechnique provides direct comparison of performance data in\nand out of vortex\n-\nUse of auto-pilot and auto-throttle significantly improved\nmaneuver and data quality\nEach test point was conducted in the same way. Once both aircraft were on condition, the trail aircraft maintained its position behind the lead aircraft for 30 sec. During this\ntime, the pilot of the trail aircraft was controlling every aspect of his aircraft, including throttles. Because of the transient nature of the vortex effects, especially with significant\nwing overlap, the pilot's throttle movements were, in some cases, coarse and over-corrective. This problem was exacerbated when combined with a significant longitudinal\ndistance like 190' N2T, because maintaining longitudinal separation became especially difficult when the pilots did not have a good visual (close) reference.\nAfter 30 sec of stable data, the pilot engaged the auto-throttle (ATC) velocity hold and held position for another 20 sec. More often than not, the ATC would have to be set a few\ntimes before the N2T closure rate was small enough to call stable. After 20 sec of stable, ATC-engaged data, the control room gave the call for 'slide out', at which time the pilot\nof the trail aircraft maneuvered laterally out of position to the right, engaged altitude-hold, and stabilized for another 20 sec outside of the vortex. The control room then gave a\n'test point complete' call at the appropriate time.\nFollowing a video of an example test point, an explanation as to why the test point procedure was set up in this way will be given.\nPage 3\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\n\nFlight Test Point Matrix\n4'\n6'\n8' 10' 12'\n-50% -25% 0% 25% 50%\n(% Wingtip Separation)\nReal-time feedback in cockpit using ILS needles\nN2T (X) position monitored through control room calls (no\ndirect feedback in cockpit)\n55 ft N2T\nPage 4\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\n-75%\n-50%\n-25%\n0%\n25%\n50%\nLateral Separation, Y, % wingspan\n50%\n25%\n0%\n-25%\n-50%\nVertical Separation, Z, % wingspan\nCondition 2\nMach 0.86\n36,000 ft\nCondition 1\nMach 0.56\n25,000 ft\nTo fully map the vortex, a grid of test points, or test matrix, was created.\nSeveral factors constrained this matrix, including:\nLimited test flights available\nThe guidance (needle) display was limited to 60 target files.\nTo maximize the resolution of the vortex mapping in the most efficient manner, the matrix was based on 1/8 of an F/A-18 wingspan, or just under 5 feet.\nTo fully map the vortex, a grid of test points, or test matrix, was created. Because flight test time was limited, the number of matrix points had to be kept to a minimum without sacrificing the\nresolution of the vortex mapping. In addition, the guidance (needle) display used by the trailing pilot to fly each test point was limited to 60 target files. Designed within these boundaries, the test\nmatrix was based on 1/8 of an F/A-18 wingspan (bF/A-18=37.5 ft), or about 4.7 ft. A grid of equally-spaced points in the Y- and Z- axis was then set up using this parameter. An example of such\na grid is shown above.\n\nAutonomous Formation Flight Test Results\nSummary Of Phase 0 -February 2001\nSummary Of Phase 1 -August 2001\nAutonomous Formation Flight Test Results\nSummary Of Phase 0 -February 2001\nSummary Of Phase 1 -August 2001\n\nPhase 0 Control Experiment #1\nSteady-State Tracking\nPhase 0 Control Experiment #1\nSteady-State Tracking\nAFF Flight 715 - February 21, 2001\n2-Minute Tracking Task\nHigh Performance Gainset\nRelative Lateral Position Error (ft)\nRelative Vertical Position Error (ft)\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n-20\n-5\n-10\n-15\nExtremely Accurate Position Outside The\nVortex Demonstrated (Winter 2001).\n(Experiment: Dial In -75/-75 ft Translations)\nExtremely Accurate Position Outside The\nVortex Demonstrated (Winter 2001).\n(Experiment: Dial In -75/-75 ft Translations)\nPage 6\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\nRelative Lateral Position Error (ft)\nRelative Vertical Position Error (ft)\n-20\n-15\n-10\n-5\n-20\n-5\n-10\n-15\nAFF Flight 714 - February 21, 2001\n2-Minute Tracking Task\nIntegral Gainset\nThe additional feedback of the integral of the position error in the INTEGRAL gainset was very successful at eliminating any steady-state offsets in position error. An undesired side-effect of the\nintegrator was larger overshoots for this gainset than for the others. However, performance and stability were still well within the acceptable region for these gains.\nThe HIGH PERFORMANCE gainset exhibited extremely good disturbance rejection capability. Position errors during steady-state tracking with these gains were approximately 1 foot both laterally\nand vertically.\n\nDrag Change Contour Plot\nContour plots:\n- Provides a true\nperspective of the vortex's\ninfluence on vehicle\nperformance\nFactors:\n- Number of test points\n- Data smoothing\n- bicubic spline\n- Extrapolation\n- missing data points\n' CD,\npercent\nM=0.56, 25,000 ft altitude, 55ft nose-to-tail\nThis particular contour plot (Mach 0.56, 25,000ft) contains 92 test points.\nPage 7\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\n\nActual Flight Test Results Validate\n\"Drag Bucket\" Theory\nP h a s e\nC o n t r o l\nR e q u i r e m e n t\nA c t\nPhase 1 Control\nPhase 1 Control\nRequirement\nRequirement\nPhase 0 Control\nPhase 0 Control\nResults\nResults\nDrag Reduction %\nDrag Reduction %\nLateral Offset (\nLateral Offset (''Y feet)\nY feet)\nVertical Offset (\nVertical Offset (''Z feet)\nZ feet)\n+'Y\n-'Z\nXf\nZf\nYf\n-'X\nPage 8\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\n\nPage 9\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\n-25%\n-20%\n-15%\n-10%\n-5%\n0%\n5%\n10%\n15%\n-0.5\n-0.4\n-0.3\n-0.2\n-0.1\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\nWing-Tip Separation (Y Relative Position), % Wing-Span\n(CD-FF - CD-BL)/CD-BL\nPercent change in drag versus position at M=0.56, 25,000ft, 55' N2T\nVertical\nSeparation,\n% Wing-Span\nZ=0.37\nZ=0.25\nZ=0.13\nZ=0.06\nZ=0.0\nZ=-0.06\nZ=-0.13\nZ=-0.25\nZ=-0.37\n'CD\n+'Y\n-'Z\nXf\nZf\nYf\n-'X\nContour Plot of Multiple Data Points\nThe change in lift and drag coefficient were evaluated for each maneuver by comparing drag while in the vortex to baseline values. In general very small changes (variations of less than 2%) in\ncalculated lift coefficient were found for all conditions as predicted.\nFor the 55 feet N2T condition shown,up to 19% drag reduction was calculated with peak values between level and -13% vertical position and a lateral position of 10-20% wingtip overlap. Overall\nthe data indicates a large region of significant gains. The data is not symmetric about the the peek position and shows increased sensitivity as the trailing aircraft moved inboard of the peak\nposition as opposed to outboard of this position. In fact, drag increases were measured at some high wing overlap positions, verifying the importance of proper station-keeping to obtain the best\nresults. Data quality varied for each test point with the outboard data tending to have better quality than the inboard data, primarily due to the pilots ability to maintain stable conditions. Some inboard\ntest points were very difficult to fly due to the lead aircraft's vortex impacting the tail or fuselage. Fortunately the region of best drag benefits was fairly stable and good data quality was obtained on\nmost points. Atmospheric conditions also affected the data on some test points due to turbulence and vertical winds. The back-to-back comparison of vortex and baseline data helped to minimize\nthese effects.\n\nTotal Drag\n'CD,\npercent\n'CD,\npercent\nCondition 2\nMach 0.86\n36,000 ft\nCondition 1\nMach 0.56\n25,000 ft\nPage 10\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\n55 ft N2T\n110 ft N2T\n190 ft N2T\n\nCompare / Contrast\n-\nMax drag reduction 30-40% greater at Condition 1 than Condition 2\n-\nOptimal location is relatively constant at all flight conditions and\nlongitudinal positions\n- Optimum Position\n- -0.20 < Y < -0.10\n- -0.10 < Z < 0.0\n-\nDrag increases calculated with high wing overlap\n-\n190 ft: Broadly distributed cross-section, poorly-defined peak\n-\nDemonstrated that only a relatively low-precision for Y-Z positioning\nis required to stay within beneficial region\n-\nMore complete picture can be developed with more exhaustive study\nPage 11\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\nCondition 2\nMach 0.86\n36,000 ft\nCondition 1\nMach 0.56\n25,000 ft\n\nDiscussion of Induced Drag\n-\nInduced drag, CDi = CD - CDo\n- CDo obtained from wind tunnel data\n-\nTheory predicts CDi will not change with flight condition\n- Simplest form, CDi = CL\n2 / (SeAR)\n- AFF data indicates slightly greater improvement at higher / faster\nflight condition with larger regions of benefit\n- Difference between flight conditions is small percentage of overall\nreduction -- May be a function of data quality, technique, or noise?\n-\nOptimum position\n- Similar to CD results\n-\nHoerner predicted CDi reduction of 40%\n- AFF results show improvement between 40 - 50% at both flight\nconditions and all longitudinal positions\nPage 12\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\n\nInduced Drag Effects More Significant at Higher Mach But\nRemarkably Consistent as N2T Length Increases\nCondition 2\nMach 0.86\n36,000 ft\n'CD,\npercent\nCondition 1\nMach 0.56\n25,000 ft\n'CD,\npercent\nPage 13\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\n55 ft N2T\n110 ft N2T\n190 ft N2T\n\nDiscussion of Fuel Flow\n-\nResults sensitive to time slice chosen\n- Throttle movement (lessened using Auto-Throttle)\n- Complete throttle cycles used\n- Atmospheric upsets\n- Changes in the lead airplane fuel flow data during a test point\nwere used to adjust trailing airplane data\n-\nTurbulent day - demonstrated improved CD in the vortex, but\nincreased fuel flow\n-\nNo data gathered at 20' nose-to-tail separation\n- Auto-throttle technique deemed too risky at this position\n-\nFuel flow data tracks drag data well\n- Comparison of drag/fuel flow results adds confidence to overall\ndata set\n-\nMax measured reduction, over 18% from baseline\nPage 14\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\n\nEffects of Longitudinal Separation\n-\nSeveral longitudinal stations flown consecutively at the perceived\n\"optimal\" location\n- Y = -0.19 b\n- Z = -0.06 b\n-\nBest benefits found at approximately X = 4.2 b, or 100 feet nose-to-\ntail\n- Close to predictions using horseshoe vortex model*\n- Afterwards, benefits slowly diminish, but are still significant\n*\nRay, R., et. al, Flight Test Techniques Used to Evaluate\nPerformance Benefits During Formation Flight AIAA-2002-4492\nPage 15\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\n\nPage 16\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\n*All data obtained at Y = -0.19b, Z = -0.06b\nPerformance as a Function of Longitudinal\nPosition*\nData was gathered to evaluate the effect of longitudinal spacing on drag and fuel-flow benefits. The \"optimum\" lateral and vertical position (Y=-19%, Z=-6%) was flow at a series\nof trailing positions to obtain this data. Additional data from the matrix of data points flow previously was also used to help fill in the chart. The results show the best benefits were\nfound at a distance of 2.7 wingspans aft (270%). This is close to the prediction shown by Blake, W., and Dieter Multhopp (AIAA-98-4343, August 1998), which uses the\nhorseshoe vortex model for a generic wing shape. Further aft the benefits begin to diminish, but are still significant. It was also found that the vortex position was not as stable\nfurther aft and seemed to wander around somewhat, based on pilot comments. The scatter in the data seems to confirm this. The open symbols represents a test point of very\npoor quality. The reduction in induced drag, forward of the maximum value, is predicted by the simple model. These results show a large region of benefit as a function of\ndownstream separation. This is good news for designers developing autonomous controllers where the engine must control longitudinal spacing. Rapid throttle movements to\nhold precise position could use excessive amounts of fuel. A low gain controller on the engine throttle should improve its ability to minimize fuel usage.\n\nChase (Control)\nSingle-seat\nF/A-18A\nLead\nTwo-seat\nTF/A-18A\nTrail\nSingle-seat\nF/A-18A\nLast Experiment Performed On Program\nX-Country Cruise Mission Formation Experiment\nSummarize everything, then ask if there are any questions...\nPage 17\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\n\nPage 18\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\n9:00:00\n9:15:00\n9:30:00\n9:45:00\n10:00:00\n10:15:00\n10:30:00\n10:45:00\nTime\nFuel Difference, lbm\nFormation\nClimb\nEstimated Duration\nSpeed Brake Was Out\nFormation\nCruise\nFormation\nDescent\n14 %\nFuel Savings\nTM Data Out of Range\nLead - Trail\nChase- Trail\nMission Profile\n40K/0.85\n41K/0.84\nFormation Flight\n15K\nLost ~ 100 lbs\n14%\nFuel Savings\nCruise Mission Demonstration\nCruise Mission Demonstration\n-\nSummary of cruise demonstration data\n-\nSimulated mission profile with independent chase of similar configuration\n-\nEstimated 110 N mi of range improvement if formation cruise continued\nA simulated F/A-18 cruise mission was performed to demonstrate the potential benefits of flying in the optimum formation position during extended periods. An independent chase aircraft was also\ndeployed during this flight to obtain fuel burn data of a F/A-18 of similar configuration and weight. Both the trailing and chase aircraft were single-seaters while the lead aircraft was a two-seater. The\nindependent chase had no data acquisition system installed. Fuel tank readings for all aircraft were recorded periodically during the mission as plotted above with the telemetry data from the two\nformation aircraft.\nThe results show significant fuel savings were recorded for the trail aircraft despite problems with the mission. Telemetry data was lost during the mission (as expected) because the aircraft flew out\nof telemetry range to accomplish the mission. When TM was reestablished it was discovered the speed brake was partially deployed on the trailing aircraft. That was corrected for the remainder of\nthe mission, however it is estimated approximately 100 lbs of fuel savings were not realized due to this problem. Also, the pilot in formation began to realize the guidance needles were not reading\naccurately as the aircraft flew further away from Edwards AFB. He continued the mission by flying by the \"seat of his pants\", using the experience he had gained during the flight test program. Even\nwith these problems, a 640lbm(14%) fuel savings was realized over the chase aircraft and over 700lbm of saving was measured compared to the lead aircraft over the duration of the formation.\nIndependent checks of the fuel required to fill-up each aircraft verified these readings to within 50lbs.\n\nAFF Roadmap\nAFF Roadmap\nPage 19\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\n9Complete\n9Complete\nFall '01,\nSummer '02\nFall '01,\nSummer '02\nSummer '03\nSummer '03\nThe objectives of the initial phase (Phase 0) of AFF research were to reduce the programmatic risks for achieving automated drag reduction. Four potential risk areas were\nidentified, the primary of which was guidance, navigation and control. Information was sought regarding the feasibility of using the Global Positioning System (GPS) for formation\nnavigation and the achievable control precision of an outer-loop autopilot. In addition, flight data was collected to be used to validate and improve the project's design tools.\nOther areas of concern were aerodynamics, flight systems and flight operations. Measurements of the effects of the vortex were collected during piloted drag reduction tests to\ncompare with simulation vortex models. Much of the systems integration effort required for the autonomous drag reduction tests was accomplished and tested during the Phase\n0 program. In addition, experience was gained by the entire project that will aid in the flight test planning of future experiments.\n\nRoadmap Charts -1\nPerformance Seeking Control\nPage 20\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\n\n\"Drag Bucket\" Hypothesis Is An Ideal Application\nFor Performance Seeking Control\nPage 21\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\nDrag Reduction (I 0)\n0.00\n0.50\n1.00\n1.50\n2.00\n2.50\n3.00\n+280\n+240\n+200\n+160\n+120\n+080\n+040\n+020\n+010\n+005\n+000\n-005\n-010\n-020\n-040\n-080\n-120\n-160\n-200\n-240\n-280\n'Y\n'Z\n- Hypothesis validated by CFD\nresults, linear theory\n- Incremental force and moment\ncoefficients function of\n-lateral separation\n-vertical separation\n-relative bank\n-lead A/C lift coefficient\n- Peak drag reduction near \"sweet\nspot\"\n-400 in laterally\n-level flight\n-same altitude\nDunn, Ken 5/21/99 Internal Boeing Report\nPeak-seeking control uses nonlinear and adaptive techniques\nto estimate and optimize a performance measure.\nCD form / CD\n+\n'\nY\n-'Z\nXf\nZ\nY\nf\n-\n'\nX\nAxis Reference System\nf\n\nFormation Flight Control\n- Peak-Seeking control adjusts\ncontrol commands adaptively to\nminimize drag and reduce throttle\nusage.\nGuidance\nControl\nEstimation\nF/A-18\nLead\nVortex\nGuidance\nControl\nEstimation\nF/A-18\nTrail\n-Vortex is unknown nonlinear\ncoupling.\n-Theory is still limited.\n-Key design trade off is\n'persistent excitation' vs. tracking error.\n- Adaptive leader commands allow\ncooperation.\nPage 22\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\n\nRoadmap Charts -2\nAutonomous Aerial Refueling Concepts\nPage 23\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\n\nLeader\nLeader--Follower Guidance Can Be Directly\nFollower Guidance Can Be Directly\nApplied To Aerial Refueling Tasks\nApplied To Aerial Refueling Tasks\nConcept Analogous To Piloted Formation Flight.\nGPS/IMU Located Onboard Leader (tanker) and follower.\nBoom dynamics & position translated onboard leader and transmitted to follower\nFollower Aircraft Tracks Position of Refueling Boom And Tanker\n-\nGuidance\n-\nleverage AFF guidance SW / HW.\n-\nfuse differential GPS with optical/radar based sensors.\n-\nControl\n-\nleverage AFF controls method.\n-\nimprovements.\n-\nSimulation\n-\nleverage AFF vortex modeling method.\n-\ndevelop batch simulation software for closed-loop\nsystem performance analysis and evaluation.\nPage 24\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\n\nPage 25\nAutonomous Formation Flight Program\nNAS4-00041 TO-104\nConclusions\n--\nDramatic Demonstration of Relative Positioning/Control\nDramatic Demonstration of Relative Positioning/Control\n--\nAccurate In\nAccurate In--Flight Wake Field Vortex Mapping\nFlight Wake Field Vortex Mapping\n--\nMaximum Reductions\nMaximum Reductions\n- Drag, up to 22%, calculated at Condition 1 for longitudinal\nseparations of X=3.0 and 4.4\n- Total fuel flow, over 18%\n--\nOptimum Positioning\nOptimum Positioning\n- X = 4.2 b (nose-to-nose)\n- -0.20 < Y < -0.10 b\n- -0.13 < Z < 0.0 b\n- 'Sweet Spot' is larger than predicted (18 ft2)\n- Region with > 25% CDi or >10% CD reduction\n- Optimum Position matches location of max rolling moment\n- Favorable effects degrade gradually with increased N2T distances\nafter peaking at 3 span lengths aft"

NEED FOR A NEW FRONT-END METHOD\n1.1.\nCritical role of front-end work in program success\nGood up-front work in the eventual success of a program. It has been stated that 80% of the\neventual costs of a system are determined before the first 20% of the funds have actually been\nspent.3 Figure 1 illustrates this graphically. It is therefore not surprising that programs that\nunder-fund front-end work (from mission feasibility through preliminary design) will have\nhigher costs later in the program. This trend is dramatically illustrated in Figure 2, taken from\nthe NASA Systems Engineering Handbook.4 Note that this figure does not consider failed\nprograms, many of which fail because of poor up-front work.\nFigure 1. Notional view of costs committed vs. costs incured over time (from Ref 3)\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\nFigure 2. Overruns correlate with inadequate front end spending (from Ref 4)\nThere are good technical and historical reasons for current practices. The overwhelming\ntechnical reason is that, if done competently and with sufficient resources (see Figure 2) they\nwork. Systems engineering practices growing out of the aerospace and defense industries of the\n1950's and 60's have allowed the creation of systems of unprecedented complexity and technical\nsophistication. Historically, they were developed in an environment of relatively abundant\nresources and the attention of a large and highly competent workforce. Most systems were doing\neither unprecedented new missions, pushing the limits of performance, or incorporating new\ntechnologies - often all three at once. Performance and mission success, for national defense\nand prestige, were the driving motivations.\nThe historical basis for current practices in the aerospace industry, and an analysis of the\nstructural changes that the industry has undergone, are covered in detail in chapters 2 and 3 of\nthe Lean Aerospace Initiative book Lean Enterprise Value.5\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\n1.2.\nProblems with classical architecting methods\nThe importance of good front-end work is clear. However, the methods for doing it are often ill-\nsuited to the current environment and do not exploit the power of modern tools and\ncomputational capabilities. From Ross et al.:6\nSpace system engineers have been developing effective systems for about fifty years and\ntheir accomplishments are a testament to human ingenuity. In addition to tackling the\ncomplex technical challenges in building these systems, engineers must also cope with\nthe changing political and economic context for space system design and development.\nThe history, scope, and scale of space systems results in a close tie with government and\nlarge budgets. The post-Cold War era has resulted in much smaller budgets and a space\nindustry that needs to do more with less. Time and budget pressures can result in corner\ncutting (such as the Mars Program), and careless accounting (such as Space Station\nProgram).\nSpace system design often starts with needs and a concept. Engineers perform trade\nstudies by setting baselines and making minor changes to seek improvement in\nperformance, cost, schedule, and risk. The culture of an industry that grew through an\nApollo race to the moon and large defense contracts in the 1970s and 1980s is slow to\nadapt a better way to design systems to ensure competitiveness in a rapidly changing\nworld.\nCurrent approaches to creating aerospace systems requirements do not adequately\nconsider the full range of possible designs and their associated costs and utilities\nthroughout the development and lifecycle.7 These approaches can lead to long design\ntimes and designs that are locally optimized but may not be globally optimized. This\npaper develops a systematic approach for space system design by addressing the\nfollowing problems: 1) A priori design selections without analysis or consideration of\nother options; 2) Inadequate technical feasibility studies in the early stages of design; 3)\nInsufficient regard for the preferences of key decision makers; 4) Disconnects between\nperceived and actual decision maker preferences; 5) Pursuit of a detailed design without\nunderstanding the effects on the larger system; and, 6) Limited incorporation of\ninterdisciplinary expert opinion and diverse stakeholder interest.\nRoss et al. concentrate on the fact that current processes may not result in an optimal solution.\nCurrent processes are also badly disrupted by changes in environments and/or user needs. If the\ntechnology used on a subsystem changes (due to lack of readiness, for example), the effects on\nthe other systems, and the ability to meet requirements, \"ripples out\". If a top level requirement\nchanges, changes flow down to all subsystems, and then the effects of the changes on interfaces\nand system integration must be considered. Such disruptions take time, and may result in a\n\"patched\" solution which is not optimal (even locally).\nExamining Figure 1, we would like a process that would put off the commitment of program\ncosts as long as possible, maintain management leverage as long as possible, and increase\nknowledge as quickly as possible, while not increasing costs incurred. In light of the above\ncomments, we would also like it to avoid early a priori design selections, include the preferences\nof key stakeholders, and increase knowledge specifically of technical feasibility and system\ninteractions, while remaining flexible to changes in environments and/or user needs. MATE\n-CON is an attempt to create such a process.\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\n2. OVERVIEW OF MATE-CON PROCESS\nHere we will walk through the process used in MATE-CON. The intent is to give the reader a\nconceptual understanding of the method and its aims so that the examples and lessons covered in\nthe next sections can be understood, and the advanced methods covered later in the book put in\nan overall context.\n2.1.\nPurpose\nMATE-CON is a process for understanding both the possibilities and the difficulties when\nlooking for solutions to complex problems. Its intent is to allow informed upfront decisions and\nplanning, so that the detailed design process which follows is aimed at the right solution, and is\nforewarned of potential problems and forearmed to seize potential opportunities.\nThe MATE-CON process is intended to be used in the early stages of product development.\nFigure 3 shows the overall product development process from concept to production ramp-up;\nthe MATE-CON process is aimed at the initial steps. This does not preclude its use for other\npurposes - our SpaceTug example is an example of the exploration of a capability, which\nproceeds only as far as concept development, while others have pushed the Concurrent\nEngineering idea (the CON of MATE-CON) to the production of hardware.\nl\nDesign\nDesign\nTesting and\nRefinement\nRamp-Up\nFrom Ulrich & Eppinger, Product Design and\nConcept\nDevelopment\nSystem-Leve\nDetail\nProduction\nPhases of Product Development\nDevelopment, 1995\nFigure 3 MATE-CON addresses early phases of product development.\nThe Multi-Attribute Tradespace Exploration (MATE) is a model-based high-level assessment of\nmany possible solutions to the problem to be considered. Ideally, the full sweep of possible\nsolutions to the problem are considered here. The key purpose of this step is to avoid premature\nconcentration on a point solution. A prematurely selected point solution may be simply a poor\nchoice. It may be an acceptable solution which nevertheless misses the possibility of a better\nvalue solution. It may even be a solution that is optimal given the information available at the\nconceptual development phase, but which is not robust to changes in environments or user needs.\nMATE gives the early decision makers a basis to explore a large number of solutions and their\nadaptability to changes. It allows this through the quantitative consideration of many aspects of\nuncertainty, including environmental or user needs changes, technical developments, policy\nchanges, and market instability. It also provides a quantitative way of assessing potential\ncapabilities (of, for example, proposed or hoped-for new technologies) through the use of what-if\nscenarios.\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\nIn this section we will walk through a quick introduction the steps in the process. The MATE\nprocess, exploration of the resulting tradespace, an the Concurrent Engineering process will be\ndescribed with detailed step-by-step instruction in how to carry them out in the following\nsections. All will be illustrated with two examples: the X-TOS ionospheric explorer vehicle, and\nthe SpaceTug orbital transfer and servicing vehicle.\n2.2.\nBackground and Origins\nFor a brief description of the intellectual origins of MATE-CON as a method, see Reference 8.\nThe referenced paper provides an overview of both the MATE-CON method and a series of\nother papers covering detailed topics within the method. The techniques used in each of the\nfollowing sections will be referenced as they are introduced.\n2.3.\nMATE8\nFigure 4 shows the conceptual flow of the MATE process.\nVector\nDefine Attributes\nDefine\nUtilities\nModel\nEstimate\nCost\nSpace\nCalculate\nUtilities\nDefine Design\nDevelop System\nArchitecture Trade\nMission Concept\nand User Needs\nFigure 4 High level description of MATE process\nThe first step is selection and bounding of a \"mission concept.\" Here, the basic issue to be\naddressed (i.e. the user needs to be satisfied), the broad scope of the solution space (i.e. what\nkinds of systems will be considered) and the scope of the analysis to be performed must be\ndecided.\nThe next step is a critical one for reducing qualitative user needs to quantitative metrics. A\nlimited number of attributes of the system need to be specified. Attributes have been described\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\nas \"what the decision makers need to consider\" and/or \"what the user truly cares about\"; they\nmust also be quantifiable, and capable of being predicted with reasonable fidelity by fairly high-\nlevel models. It is usually the result or effects of the mission that concern the user, not the\ncharacteristics of the system designed to carry it out. This lack of concern for the physical\nsystem is typical, and illustrates a key feature of the entire method--that it is driven by a set of\nquantified user needs, rather than requirements pertaining to a specific system. The attributes\nideally need to be complete (capture all important user needs) and independent; this is sometimes\nhard to accomplish at the beginning of a study, and the attribute list will sometimes evolve\nduring the process.\nOnce a list of attributes is settled on, a formal MAU process is used to determine the utility to the\nuser of values of each attribute. These individual utilities are then integrated into an overall\nutility. In both cases, \"utility\" is a dimensionless metric of \"goodness\" that is customarily\nnormalized to be between 0 (no user needs satisfied) and 1 (delighted user). In some cases, this\nmetric can be given units (e.g. cost per billable minute of a broadband telecom system), in others\n(e.g. usefulness, to scientists, of scientific data) it can only be used as a relative metric. In the\nlatter case, interpretation of these metrics is somewhat dangerous--a higher metric is better than\na lower one, but a utility of 0.5 may not be \"half as good\" as a 1.0, nor a 0.99 \"only 1% off\" from\na 1.0. Such interpretations usually require returning to the individual metrics, or the decision\nmakers. The single utility chart on the left side of Figure 5 reflects (and quantifies) the fact that\nlower altitude data is more useful to the users, with an premium on very low altitudes.\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\nData Collection Altitude (km)\nUtility\nFigure 5 A single attribute utility curve, showing utility of data colleted declining with altitude of\nthe vehicle doing the collecting.\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\nThe design vector is a list of variables that define the system architecture. To keep the analyses\ntractable, this vector must be limited to those variables that will have the largest effect on the\nattributes. The design vector may need to be revisited as the models mature.9 Often, the exercise\nof picking the design vector is one of exclusion, as variables of undoubted importance in the\nfinal design are excluded from the initial studies.\nThe system model has a well-defined and straightforward goal--calculate the attributes given a\nset of specific values of the design vector. There is no one best way to do this modeling, but\nexperience has indicated that a few commercial tools (e.g. Analytical Graphics' Satellite Tool\nKit(r) (STK), and simple analysis techniques (e.g the methods in Space Mission Analysis and\nDesign (SMAD)10) are of appropriate fidelity. Other models may have to be custom-developed\nfor specific applications. These models can be linked to automate, or at least partially automate,\nthe analyses, allowing large design spaces to be analyzed efficiently with commonly available\ncomputer resources.\nThe results of the modeling are then reduced to utilities and costs. Utilities are calculated using\nthe formalisms of MAU theory. Cost is estimated based on the best (and most appropriate)\navailable cost model. The cost models are known to have low fidelity and also to disagree by\nlarge factors.11,12 Interpreted correctly, the calculated cost should be viewed, like the utility\nmetric, as a ranking rather than an absolute and correct value. If the cost models are used in this\nsense, the danger to watched for is incorrect sensitivities in the cost models, which would cause\nthe relative costs of design options to be incorrectly ranked. To date, it has been found that this\nhas not been a major problem at the level of fidelity of the analyses used. In general, for\nexample, more complex designs have resulted in bigger and heavier vehicles requiring larger\nlaunch vehicles, and hence more expense to build and launch; the current models capture this\ntrend.\nThe result of the analysis is a database of the trade space, with thousands of potential\narchitectures mapped to the resulting attributes, utilities and costs. This database is the basis of\nthe exploration phase--the learning of the lessons that the process has uncovered. At a\nminimum, the desire is to reduce the trade space to designs worth considering, uncover the\ncontrolling physics or other constraints, and uncover the key design trades.\nData visualization and manipulation techniques are usually needed, along with patience and\ncuriosity, to understand the complex lessons of the design space. MDO methods may be very\nuseful, and indeed necessary, for exploring very large design spaces.47,48\nThe region of the trade space where attention should be focused are the designs that, for a given\ncost, produce the most utility (or, conversely, that produce a given level of utility for minimal\ncost). This region is referred to as the Pareto front. Designs that are not on the Pareto front are\nsaid to be \"dominated\"--better designs are available at the same or lower cost. Choosing\nbetween designs on the Pareto front means making real trades--better utility for greater costs, or\ntrading one desired utility against another.\nFigure 6 shows one possible slice of the trade space--the combined utility plotted against the\ntotal mission cost. In these plots, each point represents a potential architecture. The Pareto front\nis clearly visible to the upper left--the few dozen architectures that give the maximum utility for\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\na given cost. This plot does NOT uncover the controlling physics--that takes considerably more\ndelving into the database. By comparing the designs along the Pareto front, and perhaps carrying\nout some additional sensitivity studies on designs on the front, the key design drivers that move\nthe design to the front, the key design trades that move a design along the front, and the key\nphysics that prevents designs from getting any better than those on the front can be determined.\nFigure 6 shows a deterministic tradespace. The values of the utility and cost are assumed to be\nknown accurately. In many cases, uncertainties from many sources can make the exact positions\nof each of the points in the trade space uncertain. Early in the design process it is not unusual for\nuser needs, the performances of various technologies, or their actual costs to be unclear. The\nsimple models used in the tradespace analysis may introduce additional uncertainties or\ninaccuracies. Finally, there may be uncertainties or risks inherent in the mission to be\nperformed. All of these can be included in the tradespace analysis using tools to be explored\nlater in this book. As an introduction, consider the first twelve pages of an unpublished paper by\nHastings, Weigel and Walton.13\nThe process in Figure 4 is shown as being sequential, with each step following the previous one.\nIn practice, as the process proceeds, circumstances can change, or knowledge can be gained that\nchanges perceptions, causing earlier decisions to be called into question. For example, user needs\ncan to shift late in the process, or the choice of attributes or design vector can change based on\nknowledge gained during analytical model development. The process is quite robust to\niterations, however. The major time commitments are to getting \"up to speed\" on the proposed\nsystem and its related technologies, and building the analytical models. If the user needs,\nutilities, attributes, or design vector change, the process can be repeated relatively quickly by\nmodifying the analyses as necessary and rerunning them with new inputs.\n($M)\nEach point is\narchitecture\narchitectures\nTotal Lifecycle Cost\na specific\n50488 Architectures Explored\nPareto front\nof \"best\"\nFigure 6 Combined utilities and costs of fifty thousand evaluated systems\nOnce the trade space is explored, an architecture or architectures can be selected. This may be\nthe optimum architecture as determined by the analysis, i.e. the one delivering the most utility for\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\nthe minimum cost. More likely, it will be selected from a reasonable subset of architectures\n(usually on the Pareto front) by the designers and users based on a deeper exploration of the\nattributes of the architectures and the characteristics of the surrounding trade space. For\nexample, architectures whose attributes are relatively insensitive to changes in assumptions or\npoorly controlled variables may be selected as being robust, or architectures that can be rapidly\nimproved with additional resources or technology (even if they are not immediately available)\nmay be selected as being versatile or upgradeable.\n2.4.\nMATE-CON14\nOnce an architecture has been selected, rapid development of a design or set of vehicle designs is\ndone using ICE. An interdisciplinary team with tools that communicate seamlessly through a\ncommon database does design sessions in physical or at least virtual co-location. Figure 7 shows\nthe computer tools, referred to as sheets, linked to a server. Each tool is tended by a human\noperator who updates the tool as necessary (e.g. updates a CAD model), makes major design\ndecisions that are input to the tool (e.g. changes the propulsion type), and provides common\nsense and wisdom unavailable to automated methods (e.g. breaks non-convergent behavior in the\niterations). The combination of the human and the tended tool is referred to as a chair. The\ntools perform rote calculation (e.g. rough sizing of solar panels), pass information, and sum up\nsystem characteristics (e.g. mass and power budgets) automatically with each design change. A\nsession consists of inputting design changes and iterating the calculations (by having each chair\nexecute its sheet in turn, tended by the human engineer as required) until stable values are\nreached for all major system characteristics. Design changes are tried until a design is found that\nsatisfies all major requirements.\nICE design sessions typically last several hours and usually address one major trade per design\nsession. A senior team member, or \"facilitator,\" leads the design sessions and helps to resolve\ndisconnects between the clients. The design sessions are iterative, with each subsystem sending\nand receiving many times in order for the point design to converge. Although it has recently\nbecome possible to automate this iterative process, human operation of the client stations is\nalmost always preferred. The human element is actually key to the method. The human expert\ncan guide the iterations, catching bugs, nonsensical answers, divergence, and other pathologies\nthat complex computational systems are prone to. More importantly, the experts make major\ndiscontinuous design decisions, or go \"outside the box\" by stretching parameter ranges or even\nadding new computational capabilities, making the ICE method a true design tool, not just a non\nlinear equation solver.15\nThe steering by the session leader is based on a combination of traditional system requirements\nand user inputs. The latter are ideally provided by direct user/customer involvement in the ICE\nsession. ICE becomes MATE-CON with the inclusion of a MATE chair that has the results, and\noften the models, of the preceding MATE effort at his or her fingertips. The MATE chair can\nquantitatively assess the progress of the design not just towards meeting requirements, but\ntowards maximizing the overall utility of the system containing the design. He or she can also\nhelp the user/customer translate needs into design changes, and thus steer the design changes\ntowards \"sweet spots\" in the trade space. Finally, in the absence of a customer present\nthroughout the session (or the absence of one of several decision-making stakeholders, which is\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\nlikely) the MATE chair can provide a surrogate presence, assuming the stakeholders will in the\nend desire the maximum utility.\nThermal\nStructures\nCommunication\nCommand\nand Data\nHandling\nConfiguration\nPower\nPropulsion\nAttitude\nDetermination\nand Control\nMission\nSystems\nICE-Maker\nServer\nCost\nReliability\nMATE\nLeader\ncomputer tool AND\nhuman expert\nsynchronizes actions\nElectronic\ncommunication\nserver\nICE Process\n\"Chairs\" consist of\nVerbal or online chat\nbetween chairs\nbetween tools and\nKey system\nattributes passed to\nMATE chair, helps to\ndrive design session\nFigure 7 Overview of ICE process\nThe typical results of an ICE session is a design or designs at a level of detail somewhere\nbetween a conceptual design and a preliminary design.

They can also be used for higher-level, \"systems-of-systems\"\nstudies. At least with current technology, there is a practical tradeoff between the fidelity of the\nstudy and its scope; simpler systems (e.g. instruments and other sub-components) can be\ndesigned in detail, while complex systems are typically designed only to the preliminary or\nconceptual level. 17\n0%\n0%\n1%\n16%\n5%\n3%\n2%\n21%\n0%\n52%\n0%\nADACS (dry)\nC&DH\nLink\nPower\nPropulsion (dry)\nStructures & Mechanisms\nThermal\nMating System\nPayload\nPropellant\nPressurant\nPower System Mass Breakdown\nSolar array\nmass\n66%\nBattery mass\n19%\nPMAD mass\n9%\nCabling mass\n6%\nMinimum efficiency\n24.5 %\nMaximum efficiency\n28.0 %\nNominal temperature\n28.0 C\nTemperature loss\n0.5 %/deg C\nPerformance degredation\n2.6 % / year\nMinimum temperature\n0.5 C\nMaximum temperature\n85.0 C\nEnergy density\n25.0 W / kg\nSolar array mass\n150.6685167 kg\nTotal solar array area\n9.965098159 m^2\n# of solar arrays\n2 #\nIndividual solar array area\n4.98254908 m^2\nLEO Tender 1\nmass summary\nSelect solar array material:\nTriple Junction (InGaP/GaAs/Ge)\nFigure 9 Example of details available within sheets after ICE study18\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\n2.5.\nNotes on terminology, requirements, and limits\nProcess terminology14\nThe terminology used for the methods described here is far from stable. In this work, the\narchitectural-level trade space exploration is referred to as MATE, the rapid conceptual design\nprocess as ICE, and the integrated process as MATE-CON. The MATE method is an expansion\nof the Generalized Information Network Analysis (GINA) method, and many of the publications\nthat preceded this work refer to the GINA method. GINA includes the system modeling and\ntrade space exploration aspects of MATE without the front-end of a generalized multi-attribute\nutility method, and is specialized for systems that are primarily focused on information transfer,\nbut has been used generally in a similar fashion to MATE. Other researchers working on similar\nmethods have used terms such as Collaborative Engineering, Collaborative Optimization and, to\ndescribe the laying out of a tradespace for the user to select from, \"Design-by-Shopping.\"192021\nThe techniques for Concurrent Engineering referred to here as ICE go by a number of names.\nConcurrent Engineering, or the \"Design Room\" method, are commonly used. The best known\nexamples (from which this work directly descends) are The Jet Propulsion Laboratory's\nAdvanced Projects Design Team (Team X),22 the related Next Generation Payload Development\nTeam (NDPT, or Team I) 23,24 and the Aerospace Corporation's Concept Design Center (CDC).25\nOne section of this work refers to MMDOSA, which is a complement to MATE: it is a rigorous\nprocess for exploring extremely large trade spaces with multi-disciplinary optimization\ntechniques. Others may refer Stanford's separate SAM framework, which includes a quantitative\nrisk analysis model of the not only the physical system, but also management decisions made\nduring the design effort.\nOn requirements14\nThe methods described here take place at the beginning of the system design process.\nTraditional product development process descriptions often identify \"establish requirements\" as\nthis first step, so it is natural to ask how the current method interacts with the determination of\nsystem requirements.\nThe present method can be thought of as a powerful tool for coming up with the right\nrequirements at the right time. It has been noted that current processes are not efficient at\ncoming up with requirements, the resulting requirements do not necessarily provide a good\nstatement of user needs, and the potential value of the system (and even its physical feasibility)\nare not well reflected by the requirements.26 To this, we add the observation that most\nrequirements are written with a solution to the design problem in mind, and hence reinforce the\npremature narrowing of the design space that we attempt to avoid. For these reasons,\nrequirements determination is replaced by the much more general collection of user utilities in\nthe MATE process.\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\nRequirements for the space vehicle to be designed in the ICE process can be generated at the\nconclusion of the MATE process. However, by including MATE and risk chairs in the ICE\nprocess, the richness of the knowledge the user utilities, vehicle robustness, and the interaction\nbetween the vehicle and the rest of the system can be preserved into the conceptual design\nprocess, providing more flexible guidance than a set of fixed requirements.\nAt the conclusion of the MATE-CON process, on the other hand, sufficient information is\navailable to write very good requirements for the detailed design of the vehicle. This capability\nis key to avoiding classic requirements traps. The utilities capture the needs of the key\nstakeholders, without which instability is likely. Trade space knowledge allows avoidance of\nboth physically unrealistic requirements, and requirements that artificially preclude the best\nsolutions. System interactions and program and technical risks can be estimated; they are very\ndifficult to determine requirements for a priori. Finally, although flexibility and upgradeability\nare clearly key to modern acquisition models (e.g. spiral development) there is little experience\nin writing requirements for them. Most historic examples of flexible systems are serendipitous.27\nThe present method can aid in understanding flexibility issues through understanding of the trade\nspace. Designs can be specified which can be improved to provide enhanced utility with\nreasonable expense, risk, and/or need for technology advancement.\nLimits and Caveats14\nThe MATE-CON method is a useful tool for architecture selection and conceptual design, but it\nmust be used with a full understanding of the limits of the method and its component parts. The\nmethod requires careful selection of the attributes and design vector - these define the problem\nthat is being addressed. Changes in these selections late in the process may require substantial\n\"rework.\" The definition of the trade space requires models with the right fidelity. They must\ncapture the factors that differentiate the architectures under consideration without being\ncomputationally intractable or excessively difficult to prepare and integrate. They must also\nhave the correct precision given the uncertainties involved. Highly precise calculations based on\nsweeping assumptions will give misleading answers. If the problem is dominated by\nuncertainties, these uncertainties will have to be considered as part of the trade space analysis.\nParticular care must be given to the use and interpretation of cost models, which are unlikely to\ngive very accurate absolute results. The key is to assure that the cost models used provide the\nright relative answers, discriminating more expensive options from less expensive ones. The\nutility models must also be used with care. Ideally, real users, acquirers, and other stakeholders\nshould be brought into the process as often as possible, to prevent the creation of utility functions\nbased on poorly captured or shifting user needs.\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\n2.6.\nRunning Example one: Terrestrial Observer\nSatellite X (X-TOS)14\nThe X-TOS project, originally a graduate space systems design exercise at MIT, designed a\nmission for collecting information about the Earth's ionosphere necessary for the updating of the\nAFRL atmospheric drag model. The project was motivated by the poor quality of current\natmospheric drag models when used for predictions of re-entry time and location for\nuncontrolled bodies such as spent satellites.\nFigure 10 shows the MATE process as carried out for the X-TOS project. The X-TOS project\nwas scoped fairly narrowly--the customer needed a system that could deliver and support a set\nof three pre-existing instruments designed to take in-situ measurements of ionospheric\nconditions. The solution space was restricted to conventional-technology space vehicles, and the\nscope to the design and operation of these vehicles. A single AFRL scientist, representing the\nusers of the data, provided the user utility; other stakeholders were not considered.\nThe attributes of interest to the user were all characteristics of the data collected: its time span\n(time between the very first data point collected and the very last), altitude, maximum latitude,\nlatency (from collection to useful presentation to user), and the percentage of the data collected\nat or near the equator.\nThe solution space (design vector) was reduced to a set of choices of mission design, e.g. how\nmany vehicles and when they are flown, orbit elements, and some simple vehicle characteristics.\nFor the simulations, both STK and student-written orbital calculations were carried out;\nspacecraft characteristics were calculated based on SMAD, and a launch module (selecting the\nbest launcher for a given orbit and vehicle) was written based on an existing database of launch\nvehicles. These modules were used to build a database of the attributes of single vehicles in\ngiven orbits; for multi-vehicle mission designs these attributes were integrated over the lifetimes\nof the multiple vehicles. A design room with multiple personal computers considered powerful\nby the standards of the year 2001 was used to do the calculations. They took only hours, and in\nfact were entirely repeated on short notice late in the project due to a shift in user preferences.\nA MAU model was used to calculate the utilities of each architecture. Costs were calculated\nusing a hybrid of the cost estimation model in SMAD and NASA's Space Operations Cost\nModel (http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/bu2/ SOCM/SOCM.html.\nIn the case studied, drag at the low altitude where the most valuable data could be collected\nlimited mission life, becoming the key physical constraint, and also setting up the key\ntrades--increased lifetime for either increased altitude (and hence reduced data utility) or\nincreased vehicle weight (and hence cost) for added maneuver fuel. These trades are visible on\nthe Pareto front--short lifetime missions are somewhat cheaper at a penalty in utility.\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nwas quickly accommodated by changing the utilities and repeating the entire analysis, resulting\nin a revised trade space. This re-analysis took less than a day, using the pre-existing models.\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\nThe reduction of the design considerations to the key trades allowed the user a greater\nperspective into what was possible and desirable for this mission. This additional perspective in\nturn altered the users preferences, resulting in an updated utility model. In a demonstration of\nthe adaptability of the process, this change in user preferences at the conclusion of the process\nThe MATE trade space was used to drive an ICE session to design vehicles for X-TOS. The ICE\nvehicle design trades reflected the MATE trades of orbit and re-boost fuel capacity versus cost,\nlifetime and the usefulness of the data collected. The designs, one of which is shown in Figure\n11, illustrated the consequences to the vehicle of the trades that were discovered as abstractions\nin the MATE part of the process.

It was the first use of the\nMATE-CON method under contract with a government sponsor. The aim was to explore the\ntradespace of possible orbit transfer and service vehicles, looking for potential cost-effective\ncapabilities that might be of national interest.\nThe space tug concept is for a vehicle or vehicles to loiter in earth orbit and carry out multiple\nmissions involving visiting existing assets in orbit and observing, servicing, or moving them.\nThe project was motivated by a general interest in such systems as a national capability, and poor\nresults when proposing such systems for specific missions, without looking at the wider\ntradespace of possible uses and designs.\nFigure 12 shows the MATE process as carried out for the SpaceTug project. The project was\nscoped widely, as the possible uses for such a system are not currently know. A somewhat\nsimplified version of the MATE method was used. The method was adapted in response to\ndifficulties including the lack of an immediate customer and a very open design space. The\ncustomer utilities were handled parametrically to understand the sensitivities of the tradespace to\nranges of, and changes in, user needs. The analysis was done at a high level, using low-fidelity\nmodels, but covering a large range of possible designs.\nThe capabilities of a SpaceTug vehicle determined to be useful to a potential user include: (1)\ntotal delta-V capability, which determines where the SpaceTug can go and how far it can change\nthe orbits of target vehicles; (2) mass of observation and manipulation equipment carried, which\ndetermines at a high level what it can do to interact with targets, referred to here as its capability;\nand (3) response time, or how fast it can get to a potential target and interact with it in the desired\nway.\nThese attributes are translated into a single utility function. In the absence of real users from\nwhich to collect more sophisticated functions, it was decided that a simple function that could be\nexplored parametrically was most appropriate. The utility was a weighted sum of utilities from\nthe three attributes above, with the weights being considered parametically. The figure shows a\nsingle-attribute utility for Delta-V. In this case, utility is assumed to increase linearly with delta-\nV, with diminishing returns above the levels necessary to do Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to\nGeosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) transfers.\nA set of design variables (in MATE parlance, a design vector) was selected to represent possible\ntug vehicles. The following variables were selected: (1) observation and manipulator system\nmass; (2) propulsion type, and (3) mass of fuel carried.\n\nspacecraft characteristics. These were carried out on an Excel spreadsheet. The calculations\ntook only seconds, and were repeated for a wide variety of presumed user utilities.\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\nFor the simulations, simple parametric relationships and design rules were used to compute the\nThe results revealed key constraints, trades, and promising types of designs. Chemical fueled\ntugs were severely limited, especially for higher-energy missions such as GEO transfer rescues,\nby the specific impulse of the fuel. Alternate propulsion concepts had other limits: electric\npropulsion (which is slow) was highly sensitive to the assumed utility of timely response, and\nnuclear propulsion results in high base costs. Independent of propulsion system, low weight\ngrappling, observation, and control equipment was always desirable.\nThe tradespace analysis reveals three classes of potentially useful space tug vehicles. The\nElectric Cruiser occupies the \"knee in the curve\" for our nominal utilities, providing good value\nfor cost. The \"Nuclear Monster\" is only design that can meet a desire for a high delta-V, high\ncapability, rapid response system; electric monsters (not shown) might be interesting to users not\ninterested in rapid response time. A final range of vehicles occupies the lower left region of the\nPareto front. These are cost effective vehicles build using existing technology (e.g. storable bi-\npropellant systems) that can do a variety of jobs requiring lower delta-V. They could, for\nexample, tend set of vehicles in similar orbits, doing a variety of maintenance tasks. For this\nreason (and to extend the naval support vessel metaphor) they have been dubbed \"Tenders.\"\nThe MATE trade space was used to drive an ICE session to design a variety of tug vehicles.\nSeveral \"cruiser\" vehicles were designed. From on or near the Pareto front, electric cruisers such\nas the one shown in Figure 8 were designed. High delta-V chemical propulsion vehicles are not\noptimal according the MATE analysis; the ICE results (which had difficulty closing because of\nextreme fuel loads) helped to illustrate why. Finally, a variety of Tender vehicles were designed;\nsome for specific missions and some for generic service; these designs showed that a modular\napproach to tender vehicle design might be the best approach.29\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\nFigure 12 MATE process for SPACE TUG\nAttributes\n-\nDelta-V capacity\n-\nMass of\nobserving/grappling/control\nequipment (capability)\n-\nResponse time\nDesign Vector\n-\nPropulsion system\n-\nMass of\nobserving/grappling/control\nequipment\n-\nFuel load\nSystem Model\n-\nRocket Equation\n-\nParametric vehicle sizing relations\nEstimate Cost\n-\nSimple mass-based model\nCalculate Utility\n-\nParametric - many potential utilities\nconsidered\n($M2002\nConcept\n-\nGeneral purpose\nobserving/servicing/moving\n-\nUnknown missions/users\n0.00\n0.10\n0.20\n0.30\n0.40\n0.50\n0.60\n0.70\n0.80\n0.90\n1.00\nDelta-V (m/sec)\nDelta-V Utility Vv (dimensionless)\nLeo-Geo\nLeo-Geo RT\nDefine Utility\n0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nUtility (dimensionless)\nCost ($M)\nBiprop\nCryo\nElectric\nNuclear\nElectric Cruisers\nTenders\nNuclear Monsters\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\n3. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF MATE-CON PROCESS\nThe following sections will describe in considerably more detail the steps in the MATE-CON\nprocess. The sections will cover the major steps identified in the previous section. The major\nMATE steps are shown in Figure 4, and are the primary emphasis of the next sections. The\nreduction of the tradespace and the building and running of an ICE model will also be covered.\nEach step will be broken down into several tasks. They will be presented in an order designed\nfor teaching; this order is also reasonable for implementation. A slightly different order is\nincluded in the task checklist in the MATE Short Book, by Ross and Diller.30 The order of the\ntasks may be adjusted, and some tasks omitted or modified, as circumstances and the needs of\nyour project require. Task ordering and its effects on process efficiency are discussed in a paper\nby Ross and Hastings.31 Some of the tasks will also prove to be inter-related - one cannot be\nworked without the other - and will have to be worked in parallel.\nUnder some circumstances there may be some interdependencies between tasks in different\nsections. For this reason, it is important to have a reasonable understanding of the overall\nprocess, as covered in the previous section, before proceeding. With this understanding, it\nshould be possible to work the following sections more-or-less sequentially.\nThe two running examples will continue in detail on a section-by-section basis. The two\nexamples illustrate two quite different approaches to the process, in terms of the type of mission\nstudied, the goals of the project, and the level of design detail and maturity. They are intended to\nprovide the reader with ideas for implementation, rather than a rigid template.\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\n4. IDENTIFYING STAKEHOLDERS, NEEDS, MISSION CONCEPT, AND\nPROJECT SCOPE\nThe first step is selection and bounding of a \"mission concept.\" Here, the basic issue to be\naddressed (i.e. the user needs to be satisfied), the broad scope of the solution space (i.e. what\nkinds of systems will be considered) and the scope of the analysis (i.e. the boundaries of the\nsystem(s) to be considered) must be decided.\n4.1.\nIdentify Need32\nFirst, a need which a new system might satisfy must be identified. The need identification\nactivity involves identifying the initial impetus for the creation of a system. Additional needs\nmay be identified throughout the process, but the initial need is the initial driver for the system.\nWithout a clearly identified need, the designers may find it very difficult to resolve system\nambiguity and create a useful product.\nNeed usually involves the addressing some problem with the status quo. Need can arise from\nalmost any stakeholder with a problem. The key issue is to communicate the need, origin and\ncontext of the need to the decision makers in the system architecting and design process.\nTypically, need identification is interdependent with the identification of the key stakeholders in\nthe proposed system, discussed below. If the system is to be built in response to marked\ndemand, or the desire by a government or agency for a specific capability, the needs of the\nmarket or agency must be well understood. In marketing terms, this is sometimes referred to as\n\"responding to customer pull.\"33 The X-TOS project is an example of a \"pull\" project. If, on the\nother hand, the desire is to create a new capability, the interested stakeholders may not be the\nfinal users. The motivation may be described as technology or concept \"push\", with a set of\nstakeholders interested in creating a capability, with the hope that if it exists it will create market\ndemand. In this case, the needs of the interested stakeholders needs to be addressed, as well as\nthe potential needs of future users of the system. The Space Tug project illustrates this case.\n4.2.\nDefine System Concept and Scope32\nAlong with the need, the basic, highest-possible-level system concept for addressing the need\nneeds to be made explicit. Some a-priori choices about what types of systems are to be\nconsidered may be made here, depending on the needs of the project. Typically (this is a space\nsystems book, after all) this might involve a choice that the need be addressed by a space system,\nusing current or a select set of near-future technologies. Care must be taken, however, to not\nover-constrain the scope, especially in ways that might bias the solutions considered. The\nmethod is most powerful when considering high-level, open solution spaces. Therefore,\nconsideration of space, air, or ground components, or advanced technologies, should not be\ndismissed out of hand.\nTypically, space systems are part of more complex systems-of-systems. Their interactions with\nthe larger systems in which they operate will have a strong impact on their architectures. These\ninteractions must be made explicit, and if necessary made part of the system architecture study.\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\nIn order to make the problem tractable, however, it is necessary to define the boundaries of the\nsystem. Scoping the problem restricts the possible problem and solution space to something that\ncan be specifically addressed by the designers. Scoping defines what is within and without the\nareas that are to be considered. Scoping should also involve the collection of explicit\nassumptions of the system, and explicit assumptions about its interfaces with the larger world.\nThe examples again provide contrasting approaches. X-TOS is scoped fairly narrowly in order\nto quickly arrive at a system architecture and vehicle design that will respond to the user's needs.\nSpace Tug, on the other hand, includes a large space of possible solutions, but is scoped in terms\nof the aspects of the problem to be considered and the level of detail of the solutions to be\ndeveloped.\n4.3.\nIdentify Stakeholders and Decision Makers32\nIn order to understand the true or potential needs for a system, the people, groups and\norganizations that have interests in the system and its end products must be identified. A\nstakeholder is a person or organization that has \"a need or expectation with respect to system\nproducts or outcomes of their development and use.\" Examples of stakeholders include\n\"acquirer, user, customer, manufacturer, installer, tester, maintainer, executive manager, and\nproject manager... corporation... and the general public.\"34 Given definition and examples of\nstakeholders, decision makers are a subset of the set of stakeholders, with the key distinguishing\nfeature being the ability to influence the allocation of resources. Having direct control over the\nallocation of resources makes a stakeholder an obvious decision maker, however those\nstakeholders with indirect influence are not as obvious.\nAs an aid in understanding various upstream stakeholders typically not considered by the design\nengineer, a nominal framework of stakeholder and their relationships are shown in Figure 13.\nThis framework is typical for a commercial or government procured vehicle built by a for-profit\nfirm; the relationships will be different (but no less complex) for other types of systems.\nLevel 0 decision makers are classified as External Stakeholders. These stakeholders have little\ndirect stake in the system, although they may be the ultimate beneficiaries of its use. They\ntypically have control over policies or budgets that affect many systems. An example of an\nExternal Stakeholder for a space system architecture is Congress or the American people.\nLevel 1 decision makers include the Firm and the Customer. The Firm role includes those who\nhave organizational stakes in the project and manage the Designers. This decision maker may\nhave stakes in multiple projects, but has specific preferences for the system in question. An\nexample of a Firm is an aerospace company. The Customer role includes those who control the\nmoney for financing the project. According to (Martin 1997), the Customer \"is an individual or\norganization that (1) commission the engineering of a system, or (2) is a prospective purchaser of\nan end product.\" The Customer typically has preferences that balance product performance\nmeeting User needs, cost of the system, and political considerations. This decision maker\ntypically contracts to the Firm in order to build the system and provides requirements to the\nDesigner.\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\nLevel 2 decision makers include the Designer and the User. The User role has direct preferences\nfor the system and typically is the originator of need for the system. Need can originate within an\norganization, such as the Firm, as well. See Ulrich and Eppinger33 for discussions on firm\nstrategies and enterprise opportunities. An example of a User is a scientist or war fighter. The\nDesigner role has direct interaction with the creation of the system and tries to create a product\nthat meets the preferences of the Firm, Customer, and User roles. An example of a Designer is\nthe system engineering group within the aerospace company building the system. The arrows in\nthe figure depict the predominate direction of information flow, though some reverse flow does\noccur (requirements push-back, for instance).\nThe explicit task for this step is to identify the stakeholders and decision makers and their\nrelation to the system under consideration. The template in Figure 13 may be appropriate, as it\nwas in the X-TOS example, or a different set of stakeholders might need to be imaged, as was\nthe case in Space Tug. Ultimately, the goal is to identify the end users whose needs are to be\nsatisfied, the decision makers who control resources on behalf of the users, and the other\nstakeholders who may need to be satisfied in some way, who may create constraints on the\nsystem, or who may control resources useful or necessary to the systems success.\nA much deeper exploration of the concept of stakeholders and their interactions can be found in\nChapters 7 and 8 of the Lean Enterprise Value book.5\nFigure 13 Stakeholder Framework\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\n4.4.\nX TOS Need, Concept and Scope\nThe X-TOS project was motivated by the need for improved predictions of drag on orbiting\nbodies. This drag is a strong function of the density of the upper atmosphere, which itself is a\ncomplex function of seasonal, solar cycle, and other conditions. The general purpose of the X-\nTOS mission is to collect information on the upper atmosphere to allow improved density\npredictions. The improvement of this forecasting ability will serve both the military and civilian\ncommunities. Militarily, it will provide data to permit more accurate modeling in three deficient\nareas - satellite tracking, close approach/collision avoidance, and orbiting body reentry\nprediction. From a civilian standpoint, improved reentry prediction will greatly enhance early\nwarning capabilities for populated areas in the zone of impact.\nA set of instruments has been developed by the AFRL to collect the necessary data on the upper\natmosphere. A space vehicle is necessary to place these instruments in locations where they can\ncollect data of interest to the scientists developing improved drag models.\nThe mission concept of the X-TOS project was set fairly narrowly, aided by the very specific\nneeds of key stakeholders. Figure 14 shows a variety of space systems and instrument concepts\nthat can collect information on the ionosphere. It was taken from and early study.9 An a priori\ndecision was made to concentrate on the a system that could use the instruments developed and\nbuilt by the AFRL, which limited consideration to in-situ systems - systems that orbit through\nthe regions of interest. Cost considerations also limited the number of vehicles considered to\ntwo. A programmatic decision was made to consider only independent missions - no possible\nsharing of a vehicle with other missions was considered.\nThe scope of the analysis of was also set fairly narrowly. Figure 15 shows the flow of\ninformation from the ionosphere itself to the ultimate users of the improved drag models.\nIdeally, the system would be optimized to meet those users needs. However, lack of maturity of\nthe drag model and information distribution system precluded modeling of these aspects of the\nsystem of systems. Instead, the space segment up to the delivery of data to the ground was\nmodeled, and the system was designed to optimize the delivery of data useful to the developers\nof the as-yet incomplete models.\nThe\nequivalent stakeholders were:\nDesigner:\nSpace System Design course students\nUser:\nAir Force Research Lab (AFRL/Hanscom, Dr. John Ballenthin)\nFirm:\nProfessors, staff\nCustomer:\nAerospace Corporation\nExternal:\nEventual capability users (NORAD/USAF) and beneficiaries (public),\nexisting space law and policy, policy setters (Congress).\n32,35\nThe framework in Figure 13 was modified to capture the relationships for this project.\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\nThe development was carried out in an academic (term project) environment. Although the\nresults of the project were not actually pitched to the Aerospace corporation, such small science\nmissions ultimately would have to be, so they were designated the customer. This project had\nthe luxury of a well defined user who would ultimately make recommendations to the customer,\nso a single key decision maker (that user) was identified.\nFigure 14 Techniques for collecting information about the ionsphere\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\nFigure 15 X-TOS system-of-systems with selected scope\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\n4.5.\nSpace Tug Needs, Concept and Scope\nThe Spacetug project was motivated by the desire for a national infrastructure that would allow\nthe observation, servicing, and moving of existing space assets. The users of such services are\nnot currently well defined. Some missions can be defined based on existing assets and needs;\nothers may emerge once such a capability exists. Among the potential developers and customers\nfor such as system, there is a need to understand systems that maximize potential usefulness.\nThe mission concept of the Space Tug project was very open: a vehicle or vehicles capable of\nvisiting a variety of orbits in near-earth space and performing unspecified jobs there, including\nchanging the orbits of target vehicles. The scope of the analysis, on the other hand, was set fairly\nnarrowly: only the vehicle bus was considered. Key issues involving the equipment and software\nnecessary to perform orbital servicing and mating were considered in a separate study. This\nequipment was treated as a generic capability, which interfaced with the vehicle by having mass,\nand consuming power and communications bandwidth. Except for the communication issue, the\ncommand and control of the servicing equipment was also not considered. It was also assumed\nthat existing infrastructure for launch, communication, and bus command and control would be\nused.\nThe stakeholder framework was challenged by the fact that there was no fixed user for the\nsystem. In this case, the customer (the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA),\nwho was actually dedicating resources to the project) desired to create a capability of maximum\nusefulness to an uncertain user base. This situation was the opposite of the X-TOS project, which\nhas a real user, but only a theoretical customer. The key decision maker in this case is the\ncustomer, acting as a surrogate for perceived future users. The development was carried out in\nan academic (summer project) environment. As this was a small research project, the Firm role\nwas minimized. The equivalent stakeholders were:\nDesigner:\nProject students and staff\nUser:\nUnknown - commercial and government space users\nFirm:\nHost university and interested faculty\nCustomer:\nDARPA\nExternal:\nFuture direct beneficiaries (Military and civilian space users), indirect\npolicy setters (Congress).\nbeneficiaries (US and world public), existing space law and policy,\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\n5. DEFINING THE TRADESPACE\n5.1.\nIntroduction32\nDefining the trade space is the critical next step in the MATE-CON process. In this step, the\nuser's (and possibly other stakeholders') preference space is defined. This preference space will\nbe used to evaluate the members of a design space, which must also be defined now.\nThe preference space consists a number of attributes of the proposed system, and a set of utility\nfunctions that map the values of the attributes to user utilities. The attributes are functional\ndescriptions of the outputs or outcomes of the working system, not physical features of the\nsystem itself. They must be carefully chosen to correctly represent the aspects of the system that\nthe user cares about, and must have certain features (such as perceived independence) that will\nallow them to work as bases for a utility analysis. The utility functions are dimensionless\nrepresentations of the relative desirability of various values of the attributes. Together, the\nattributes and utility functions define a wide range of functional system outcomes, evaluated in\nterms of their utility to the user(s).\nThe design space consists of a number of design variables that can be varied to define a large\nnumber of possible physical designs that might create the desired outcomes. Given the infinite\nchoices facing a clean-sheet designer, the design space is a reduction of all possible design\nsolutions to a tractable number of them. The selected design variables are referred to as the\ndesign vector; ideally these are the variables that are under the designers' or system engineers'\ncontrol and have a large impact on the attributes of the system. The use of the term \"design\nspace\" should not be interpreted to imply anything about the level of detail of the problem; a\nhigh-level architecture or a low-level component design can be considered equally well by the\nmethod.\nUltimately, the goal of the MATE process is to map the design space to a space of evaluated\ndesigns (the solution space or, often, the trades pace). This is accomplished by using simulation\nmodeling to predict the attributes of all of the designs in the design space, and then using the\npreference space to understand the utility of the designs to the user. A rough view of this\nmapping is shown in Figure 16.\nTwo caveats are immediately in order. One is that the choices of attributes and design space\ndefine the bounds of the trade space. Incorrect choices will result in a trade space that does not\nreflect the users true needs, or does not contain the best solutions. Thus it is both important that\nthe attributes and design vector be chosen carefully, and highly likely that these choices will\nneed to be revisited as the project matures.\nThe other caveat is that the entire process represents an approximation of the users desires and\nthe capability of various designs to fulfill them. The preference space approximately quantifies\nthe users' needs; the design space represents a tractable subset of the infinite possible solutions;\nthe simulation space is a tractable model of the proposed systems in action, and the solution\nspace is the necessarily approximate result. At an early stage in the design or architecting\nprocess, these approximations are necessarily rather coarse. It is therefore vital that the trade\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\nspace analyst understand these approximations, and understand the significance (or lack thereof)\nof the trade space results.\nDefine Design\nDefine Attributes\nUtilities\nEstimate\nCost\nArchitecture Trade\nSpace\nMission Concept\n& User Needs\nUtilities\nVector\nDefine\nDevelop System\nModel\nCalculate\nPreference Space\nDesign Space\nSimulation Space\nSolution Space\nFigure 16 Design, preference, simulation and solution spaces\n5.2.\nDefining Constraints32\nA necessary step in defining the design and preference spaces is explicitly defining any hard\nconstraints that may preclude choices of attributes or design variables. Constraints may be due\nto policy or political choices (for example, U.S government payloads must ride U.S. launch\nvehicles), funding constraints (maximum dollar or dollar-per-year amounts), hard customer\npreferences (consideration of only a subset of solutions that are in the customers interest to\npursue), or other reasons.\nIt is important to make these constraints explicit in the development of the MATE model in order\nto understand their effects on the trade space. A will be seen later in this book, constraints can\noften have unintended negative consequences, driving up costs or precluding good solutions.\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\n5.3.\nDefining Attributes32\nWhat is an attribute?\nBefore continuing, the term \"attribute\" must be defined. An attribute is a decision maker-\nperceived metric that measures how well a decision maker-defined objective is met. Attributes\nhave been described as \"what the decision makers need to consider\" and/or \"what the user truly\ncares about.\" In practice, they must also be quantifiable, and capable of being predicted with\nreasonable fidelity by fairly high-level models. They can have natural or artificial units. All that\nmatters is that the decision maker being assessed has a preference for different levels of that\nattribute in a well-defined context.\nAttributes have a number of characteristics that must be explicitly determined through\ninteractions with the decision maker. Attributes have a definition, units, range, and a direction of\nincreasing value. All of these characteristics must be determined in order to properly design a\nsystem. The definition is incredibly important and must be determined by the decision maker to\nensure that decision maker has a preference on the attribute. Units must be clarified in order to\nenable the Designer to accurately assess potential designs. The range is defined from the least-\nacceptable value (worst acceptable case) to the dream value (best case, above which delivers no\nadditional value). Note that an attribute value at the least acceptable value is still acceptable.\nLastly, when the range is defined, it also specifies the direction of increasing value--from worst\nto best case.\nTable 1 contains examples of attributes drawn from case studies. The table shows the variety of\npossible attributes. The ATOS, BTOS, and XTOS systems (all designed to collect information\non the earths ionosphere), and the Space Based Radar (from Spaulding37) have attributes that\nreflect scientists' or warfighters need for specific data collected. The attributes tend to be\nspecialized and non-intuitive to the lay-person (and the designer!) and were determined with\nsome difficulty. The Launch System4 and Space Tug attributes are simple and relatively intuitive\ncapabilities of the system, representing the customers' high-level interest in establishing national\nassets. The communication system attributes reflect the needs of the end-users of the\ncommunication network; they are standard network theory attributes, referred to in the original\nwork as the GINA metrics. The generalize attributes from the INCOSE SE Handbook are\ninterestingly similar.\nSome of the examples in Table 1 were taken from work which did not use the MATE method.\nInstead, they specified fixed values of the attributes, which defined functional system\nrequirements. This is generalizable - fixing the value of an attribute usually results in a\nfunctional requirement. This analogy should not, however, be taken too far; fixing all the\nattributes of a MATE study does not necessarily result in a complete set of functional\nrequirements, nor can a good attribute set necessarily be developed simply by \"floating\" a set of\nfunctional requirements over a range of values.\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\nTable 1: Examples of Attributes\nATOS:9\nEquatorial Survey: presence of vehicle(s) in equatorial zone\nEquatorial Snapshot: complex function of relative vehicle positions to image ionosphere disturbances\nHigh Latitude Survey: Function of relative vehicle positions to map quasi-static ionosphere\nBTOS:43\nMission Completeness: Combination of missions performed (AOA, EDP, turbulence).\nSpatial Resolution: Arc length of Earth between complete measurement sets.\nRevisit Time: Time between subsequent measurements of the same point above the Earth.\nLatency: Time delay from measurement to data reception by the end user.\nAccuracy: Measurement error in angle of arrival data from ground beacons.\nInstantaneous Global Coverage: percent of Earth's surface in view between subsequent measurements\nXTOS:44\nData Life Span: Elapsed time between the first and last data points of the entire program\nSample Altitude: Height above standard sea-level reference of a particular data sample\nDiversity of Latitudes Contained in Data Set\nTime Spent at the Equator: Time per day spent +/- 20 degrees off the equatorial\nLatency: The elapsed time between the collection of data and the start of transmission\nSpace Based Radar:45\nMoving Object Tracking Area: Area in which a moving targets may be spotted\nMinimum Detectable Target Speed: Minimum speed for target to register as \"moving\"\nImage Resolution: Resolution of static imaging capability\nImage size: Area captured in static image\nGeo-location accuracy: Error ellipse of position information\nGap Time: Time a target may go unobserved\nCenter of Gravity Area\nLauncher:4\nMass injected\nInjected speed (orbits attainable)\nAvailability\nSpace Tug:46\nDelta V change possible\nCapability of on-board equipment (grapplers, observation equipment, etc)\nResponse Time\nGINA Metrics:38\nSignal Isolation: the ability to distinguish the desired signals from other information\nInformation Rate: the rate at which information is generated or transmitted\nInformation Integrity: the inverse of the error rate\nInformation Availability: the probability that the generation/transmission will be successful\nINCOSE General Attributes (detailed definition application dependent):39\nQuantity\nQuality\nCoverage\nTimeliness\nAvailability\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\nThe attributes will be used to determine the utility of the system to the user. In order to facilitate\nthe use of formal utility theory (to be covered in following sections) the attributes should follow\nthe following rules. According to Keeney and Raiffa,40 a set of attributes must be complete,\noperational, decomposable, non-redundant, minimal, and perceived independent to ensure\ncomplete coverage of a decision maker's preferences (see Table 2). Operational means that the\ndecision maker actually has preferences over the attributes. Decomposable means that they can\nbe quantified. Non-redundant means none are double-counted. Minimal and complete are in\ntension, since Designer seeks to capture as many of the predominant decision metrics as possible,\nwhile keeping in mind the cognitive limitations in practice. (The human mind can typically only\nthink about 7±2 objects simultaneously.41) The perceived-independent property is important for\nthe utility independence axiom, described below, to hold. (The attributes need only be\n\"perceived\" independent; they do not need to actually be independent!) In practice, no set can be\nsimply guaranteed to have all of these properties. The details of these restrictions and their\nconsequences will be covered in greater depth in the section on utility theory.\nTable 2 Characteristics of Attributes\nCharacteristics of attributes\nCharacteristics of a set of attributes\nDefinition\n-\nComplete\n-\nNon-redundant\nUnits\n-\nOperational\n-\nMinimal\nRange (worst++best)\n-\nDecomposable\n-\nPerceived-independent\nDetermining Attributes\nThe process of defining the attributes usually starts with preliminary interactions with possible\nusers. Interviews, literature reviews, or other interactions with users, decision makers, and their\nwork is necessary to understand the users needs, and imagine appropriate attributes. As part of\nthis process, it is helpful if the interaction is two-way, so that the user or his or her representative\nunderstands the meaning and use of the attributes, and is ready for the utility interviews defined\nin the next section.\nIdeally, attributes describe a function or output of a system. Thinking functionally is sometime\ndifficult, especially for those with experience in traditional design methods. Functional thinking\nis key to defining concept-independent attributes that will not inherently bias later evaluations.\nThat said, concept-independent attributes enable Designers more latitude in the design process,\njust as functional requirements enable more freedom than form requirements, but they are not\nabsolutely required by the method.\nProbe the needs that originated with the User and try to develop objective statements regarding\nthese needs. The attributes will be quantifiable parameters that measure how well these\nobjectives are met. A preliminary list of attributes allows the design team to begin to understand\nthe modeling framework for the system.\nDefining a set of attributes is a bit of an art. The examples in Table 1may provide a starting place\nfor thinking about what the attributes may look like. Brainstorming with as many stakeholders\nas possible is a desirable first step. Using standard brainstorming technique, collect many\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\npossible attributes, and try to group similar ones together and eliminate weak ones. Attributes\nwhich cannot be quantified, or for which ranges cannot be established, are not useful. Attributes\nwhich have only one acceptable value are really constraints. Attributes which describe physical\ncharacteristics of the system rather than its functions or outcomes may be design variables (next\nsection) or they may simply be misguided. Thinking in terms of \"decision metrics\" is valuable.\nAn important question to ask the decision maker: \"when deciding on a particular design, what\nare the characteristics that you would consider?\" Those characteristics are often good attributes.\nAnother method to define attributes is through a hierarchy of objectives. (See Keeney and\nRaiffa40 and Smith, Levin et al.42 for example frameworks.) <this needs to be hooked in concrete\nways to the architecture/design framework?>.\nIn all cases, remember that the attributes should be appropriate to the level of analysis being\ncarried out. Although there is no absolute limit to the number of attributes that can be handled,\nexperience suggests that three to seven attributes is appropriate. Architecture studies should be\nconcerned with a few of the highest-level functions of the system or systems. If brainstorming\n*\nproduces too many attributes, it is likely that the group is thinking at too detailed a level.\nFinalizing Attribute Definitions\nThe attributes will need to be iterated with stakeholders. They will be reevaluated in light of\nadditional information that will emerge when the design vector is chosen and the attributes and\ndesign vector elements are correlated (see the next section). They also may need to be\nreevaluated or redefined as part of the process of formally quantifying them with multi-attribute\nutility theory. Finally, the results of the tradespace evaluation may require new attributes to be\nexamined, and/or call into question the original choices. These iterations on the attribute\ndefinitions require progressively more work, so it is desirable to do the best job possible at each\nstep.\nIdeally, the attributes would be developed in full cooperation with the user. More typically, after\nthe first interaction, the design team works on the attributes and returns to the users with a\npreliminary list. The user must critically assess if the proposed attributes accurately capture his\nor her needs. The team must also insure that the conditions in Table 2are met. The decision\nmaker is also asked to provide or confirm a range for each attribute corresponding to the best\ncase and the worst case. The best case is the best value for the attribute from which the user can\nbenefit; a better level will not give more value. The worst case corresponds to the attribute value\nfor which any further decrease in performance will make the attribute useless. These ranges\ndefine the domain where the single attribute preferences are defined. The attributes have to\ndescribe decision maker needs accurately in order to meaningfully assist the trade study. Iteration\nwill almost certainly be required to find the right attribute set.\nThe final result is a finalized and mutually agreed upon list of user attributes including their\ndefinitions, ranges, units, and direction of increasing value.\n* Nested utility functions are possible to capture more than six attributes, however nesting adds complication and\nrequires a sophisticated MATE engineer.\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\nA note on cost\nCost may be thought of as an attribute, but in the examples given here it is treated somewhat\ndifferently. It is clearly quantifiable, and has an obvious direction of preference (lower is better).\nHowever, defining upper and lower bounds on cost during concept exploration will be arbitrary\nand may be excessively restrictive. Financial resources tend to be controlled by different\nstakeholders than the technical attributes. In government systems, the user community may set\nthe technical attributes, but the available funds will be controlled by the acquisition agencies and\ncongress. Calculation of cost is independent of the calculation of technical attributes, usually\nusing very different types of models. The cost estimates may be of considerably lower fidelity\nthan the technical simulations, especially when new concepts are being considered. Finally, cost\nis a useful independent criterion against which to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of\nvarious levels of technical performance. For all these reasons, cost will be treated separately\nfrom the other attributes.\nThis does not mean that finding levels of funding which the customer is interested in providing is\na bad idea. If the customer is very determined to keep costs below a certain level it can be\nincluded as a constraint in the trade space, and in any case it can be kept in mind when exploring\nthe tradespace.\nThe expenditure of resources other than money may need to be included in the tradespace as\nwell. If the system places extraordinary demands on a limited asset (e.g. the communications\nbandwidth of the TDRS system) then this resource burn should be included as either a\ncomponent of cost or as an attribute. In the former case it needs to be converted into dollars. In\nthe latter, it needs to be restated as a desirable characteristic, e.g. efficient transmission of\ninformation.\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\n5.4.\nX-TOS Attributes32\nThe X-TOS attributes were determined by the needs of the science users. They needed a data set\nconsisting of measurements from the predetermined instrument package (this was a constraint)\ncollected over a period of time, at varying altitudes and latitudes, and transmitted with some\nlatency to the ground. The scientists cared about all of these aspects of the data. This interest\nwas quantified by brainstorming with the user a preliminary set of attributes:\nKnowledge/Accuracy Altitude\n(km)\nMission Lifetime\n(months)\nTime spent in region\n(min)\nLatitude range\n(degrees)\nLatency\n(min)\n# Simultaneous data pts\n(integer)\nData Completeness\n(%)\nPointing Accuracy\n(degrees)\nPointing Control\n(degrees)\nThese preliminary attributes suffered several of the weaknesses mentioned above. Some are not\ndiscriminating, e.g. the pointing accuracy was easily within any reasonable vehicle's capability.\nOthers where not well posed for quantifying, e.g. time spent in various regions. Others were not\nfunctional, e.g. mission lifetime described the lifetime of a physical vehicle; the scientists were\ninterested in the time from the collection of the first data point to the last, which could be\ncollected by more than one vehicle or even system, hence \"Data life span\" below. The attributes\nwere ultimately reduced to the following set, and upper and lower bounds set:\nTable 3 X-TOS Attributes\nAttribute\nUnits\nBest\nWorst\n1) Data Life Span\n(years)\n0.5\n2) Sample Altitude\n(km)\n3) Diversity of Latitudes in Data Set\n(degrees)\n4) Time Spent in Equatorial Region\n(hours/day)\n5) Latency\nScientific Mission\n(hours)\nTech Demo Mission\n(hours)\n0.5\nData Life Span: Elapsed time between the first and last data points of the entire program, measured in years.\n(Data sample = a single measurement of all 3 instruments)\nchange\nset, measured in degrees.

These difficulties will be\naddressed in the utility section to follow.\n5.5.\nSpace Tug Attributes\nThe space tug attributes were defined at a very high level. They reflect several decisions made at\nthe front end of the trade study. The Space Tug is a hypothetical capability. Only the vehicle\nwas considered in the first stage of the study. Key vehicle systems (such as grappling\nmechanisms) and operational details (such as software for rendezvous) were studied separately\nfrom the trade studies. The capabilities of a space tug vehicle determined to be useful to a\npotential user included:\nTable 4 Space Tug Attributes\nAttribute\nUnits\nBest\nWorst\n1) Delta V capability\nkm/sec\n>0\n2) Equipment carrying capability\nkg\n3) Response time\n-\nfast\nslow\nDelta-V capability: determines where the space-tug can go and how far it can change the orbits of target\nvehicles\nEquipment carrying capability: mass of observation and manipulation equipment (and possibly spare parts, etc.)\ncarried, which determines at a high level what it can do to interact with targets\nResponse time: how fast it can get to a potential target and interact with it in the desired way. This was initially\nconsidered only in a binary sense of fast (hours to days) or slow (weeks to months).\nThese were confirmed with the customer, but not initially iterated with him. At the conclusion of\nthe first phase of the study, the customer expressed a desire to include launch systems and some\noperational details (storage and parking modes and locations) in the trade study. This required a\nrethinking of the attribute list, although it proved to be relatively minor. The updated attribute\nlist included a quantified response time, in hours, from 1 (best) to 2160, or three months (worst).\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\n5.6.\nDefining the Design Space32\nWhat is a design space?\nOnce the attributes have been determined, the designers need to develop concepts to perform the\nmission, which are reflected in the construction of a design vector. The design vector focuses on\nthose variables that have been identified to have significant impact on the specified attributes. A\ntension will exist between including more variables to explore a larger tradespace and the\ncomputational difficulty for actively exploring such a large space. Geometric growth of the\ntrades pace results with increasing number of variables and the values over which they are\nenumerated. Computational considerations motivate keeping the list curtailed to only the key\nelements, while still maintaining the ability to keep the trade space as open as possible in order to\nexplore a wide variety of architectures.\nAs a good general practice, a constants vector is also defined. This vector includes many\npotential design variables which are, for a variety of reasons, fixed for all analyses. These could\nbe design variables that are assumed to be weak impact, variables reflecting the current\neconomic and technical situation (that could conceivably change in the future but are not\nexpected to impact the design), or any other variable that is not selected for the design vector.\nThe constants vector might also include physical constants, constraints, and scoping assumptions\nfor the model. Placing them in a constants vector allows them to be parametrically varied to\nassure that the models are not sensitive to them, varied to perform what-if scenarios, or\nconverted to design variables quickly and easily.\nTable 5 shows some example design vectors used in MATE analyses. The ATOS and BTOS\nvectors concentrate on the arrangements of swarms of small vehicles configured to collect data\nand maximize their respective attributes. Note that the ATOS vector contains no design vector\nelements concerning the design of the vehicles themselves; the performance of the swarms are\nonly weakly dependent on the performance of the individual vehicles, so a nominal high-level\nvehicle design is placed in the constants vector. BTOS has only the highest level of vehicle\nconcerns in the design vector: the configuration study relates to some high level options for\nwhich instruments and capabilities go on which vehicles. The XTOS design vector contains both\norbital elements and high-level vehicle choices; the mission scenarios include the possibility of\nmore than one vehicle. The space based radar design vector is a similar mix of vehicle and orbit\nvariables, with constellation type including numbers of vehicles and orbit types. Finally, the\nSpace Tug design vector is a high level description of the vehicle.\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\nTable 5 Sample Design Vectors\nATOS: 9\nSwarm perigee\nSwarm apogee\n# sats/swarm\n# subplanes/swarm\n# suborbits/subplane\nYaw angle of subplanes\nMax sat separation (swarm diameter)\nBTOS:43\nCircular orbit altitude (km)\nNumber of Planes\nNumber of Swarms/Plane\nNumber of Satellites/Swarm\nRadius of Swarm (km)\n5 Configuration Studies\nXTOS:44\nAltitude of Apogee (km)\nAltitude of Perigee (km)\nInclination (deg)\nTotal Delta-V (m/s)\nComm.

The first list should be inclusive-the desire at this stage is to create a\nlist from which the actual design vector will be reduced. Typically, design vector variables are\ndescriptions of the form of the solution. For space vehicles, this might include vehicle types,\nsubsystem choices, fuel loads, technologies used. For space systems, this might include orbits,\noperating and communications modes, ground and launch systems used, etc.\nLike the attributes, choosing the design vector is something of an art. In general, however, it is\nmore straightforward, as the design vector represents the physical characteristics of the system,\nwhich are easier to imagine and discuss than functional characteristics. Generally, more design\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\nvector elements can be used than attributes, although too many will make the simulations\ncomputationally intractable. The key to limiting the design vector is again selecting the right\nlevel of analysis.\nThe usual brainstorming process may produce many possible design vector elements, which\nmust be reduced to a computationally tractable set. This is a process of reduction that can be\ncarried out by a number of means. An effective technique is to map the proposed design\nvariables against the attributes, and use educated guesswork or back-of-the-envelope modeling to\nestimate the likely impact of the design variables on the attributes. Design variables which have\na strong impact on the attributes (and hence will have an strong impact on the user utilities) and\nwhich are actually under the control of the designer (and hence can be varied significantly) are\ndesired. Eliminated variables can be left in the constants vector; later in the process, sensitivity\nanalyses can be performed to validate the assumption that they only weakly impact the attributes.\nFinalization of the design variables is necessary before code development can begin. Proposed\ndesign variables become finalized after the attributes have been finalized and an understanding\nof the dependencies between the design variables and attributes has been understood. In addition\nto the identity of the design variables, the values to be used also need to be picked at this point.\nContinuous variables (e.g. fuel load) need to be checked at a number of fixed values, which must\nbe chosen, while discrete ones (e.g. mission scenario) need to be fully defined and quantified.\nUpdating the design vector\nExperience has shown that the design vector is the least stable element in the trades space. As\nthe modeling, and even the analysis, progress, design variables may prove irrelevant or non-\ndiscriminating. As often, sensitivity studies or changes in user preferences elevate variables\nconsigned to the constants vector to design vector status. The enumeration of the design vector\nwill almost always change somewhat, as sensitive regions of the trade space are identified that\nrequire more detailed looks. The model architecture should reflect this by being as modular as\npossible, and by including as many variables as practical in a constants vector rather than\n\"hardwiring\" the values into code.\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\n5.7.\nX-TOS Design Vector35\nThe definition of the design vector begins with the consideration of user specified attributes (see\nChapter 3). Since these attributes define user utility, and the objective of the designer is to\nmaximize that utility it follows that the designer would choose a set of design variables that have\na high degree of leverage in changing the values of these attributes. In the case of the X-TOS\nattributes, two key groups of variables emerged: the orbit(s) in which data would be taken, and\nthe spacecraft(s) taking that data.\nIn the case of X-TOS orbits, three parameters were chosen: the altitude of apogee, the altitude of\nperigee and the orbital inclination. Of course these three parameters are not sufficient to fully\nspecify a keplerian orbit; rather a total six orbital elements are needed. The remaining elements\nare not included in the design vector since they either do not provide leverage in changing utility\nor there is an obvious utility maximizing choice. For example, since only the latitude and altitude\n(not the longitude) of a particular data point is of interest to the user, the right ascension of the\nascending node is not included. On the other hand, since the altitude and latitude range attributes\nare taken independently (i.e. the user is not expressing preferences for combinations of altitudes\nand latitudes) one would immediately choose the argument of perigee to align the line of nodes\nwith line of apsides. Such a selection maximizes the time in the equatorial region without\naffecting the other attributes. These remaining elements are included in the constants vector.\nUnlike the orbits, appropriate design variables used to describe the spacecraft are not readily\napparent from the attributes. In general, the computational and modeling resources available will\ntend to reduce the scope of possible architectures. The X-TOS team decided to eliminate\nconcepts such as tethers since sufficiently fast and accurate models of their behavior were not in\nhand and could not be constructed in the time allotted. After reducing the scope of possible\nsatellites, to relatively small traditional designs using off the shelf technologies, key sub-system\nlevel trades were identified.\nThe final step in defining the design vector is to choose at which discrete levels to sample the\ncontinuous design variables. The designer needs to choose a sufficient diversity of levels to\nensure coverage of the tradespace, yet balance that choice with the additional computational\nexpense of more levels. Often the number of combinations of design variables grows\ngeometrically with the number of levels per design variable. The key is to use the attributes and\nutility functions to help define interesting areas of the trade space. For example in X-TOS, the\nlevels orbital parameters were chosen to ensure breadth in inclination and a preference for low\naltitudes. There is some degree of art to this choice since one does not want to eliminate high\nutility areas of the tradespace. In X-TOS, the Total Delta-V design variable was capped at 1000\nm/s (a cap that was thought to be conservative). During the detailed design phase (MATE-CON)\nit was discovered that values of in excess of 1200 m/s. were tenable.\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\nTable 6 X-TOS Design Vector\nDesign Variable\nLevels\nJustification\nAltitude of Apogee (km)\n200:50:350;\n650:300:2000*\nEmphasis on low altitude in utility function, therefore\nsample at a higher rate at low altitudes\nAltitude of Perigee (km)\n150:50:350*\nUtility curve declines quite steeply between 150 and 350\nkm; will take a significant utility hit if spacecraft never\nflies below 350\nInclination (deg)\n0; 30; 70; 90\nCovers the possible range of inclinations\nTotal Delta-V (m/s)\n200:100:1000*\nThe low end of the range is a high average value for low\nearth orbit satellites.

Per the assumptions made at\nthe beginning of the study, only the characteristics of the vehicle were considered. A very wide\ntradespace was considered, so only the design choices likely to have first order effect on the\nattributes were considered. The final design vector was:\nTable 7 Space Tug Design Vector\nDesign Variable\nUnits Levels\n1) Mass of on-board equipment\nkg\n300;1000;3000;5000\n2) Propulsion type\n-\nStorable bi-prop; cryogenic; electric; nuclear\n3) Fuel or reaction mass\nkg\n30;100;300;600;1200;3000;10000;30000;50000\nMany other potential design variables, with weaker or less discriminating effects on the\nattributes, were placed in the constants vector. These included: bus systems (structure, thermal,\nnon-propulsion power, and control and communications systems), which were reduced to a rule-\nof-thumb mass; the details of the propulsion system (Isp, mass, and power), which varied\nbetween the various types of propulsion but were fixed for each type; and development and\nlaunch costs, which were build on rules of thumb. All of these were set to reasonable nominal\nvalues.\nAt the conclusion of the first phase of the study, the customer expressed a desire to include\nlaunch systems and some operational details (storage and parking modes and locations) in the\ntrade study. This required a rethinking of the design vector, to include additional variables such\nas storage modes (ground vs. orbit), parking orbits, and launch options.\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\n5.9.\nPreparation for modeling: Final attribute-design vector mapping\nIn order to structure the modeling stage of MATE, covered in the next sections, it is necessary to\nfully understand the anticipated relationship between the design variables and the attributes.\nNotional mappings of design variables to attributes allow for the conception of necessary\nmodules for the model. This activity is done in parallel with the proposal and finalization of\ndesign variables since it helps prioritize design variables and pare down the proposed list.\nA technique similar to Quality Function Deployment (QFD, also referred to as the House of\nQuality) is used to relate the attributes and design variables. It is very important to note that the\npurpose of the mapping is to anticipate how each design variable will impact the attributes, NOT\nto find the values of the design variables (and thus specify the design) as is the case when the\nmethod is used in its traditional way.\nAs shown in the examples, Attributes are listed on the rows, and Design variables are listed on\nthe columns. Note cost is included as a special row, befitting its role as a special attribute. The\ndegree of expected impact (how much the design variable is expected to affect the attribute) is\nrated as first order (9), second order (6), small (3) or zero (0). These rankings can be obtained by\neducated guesswork, back-of-the-envelope calculations, experience, or expert opinions. They\nare intended to help the process rather than provide solutions, so best-effort work here is\nexpected and acceptable.\nThe central matrix gives a visual summary of the complexity of the calculations that will be\nnecessary to compute the attributes given the design vector. A heavily-populated matrix tends to\nindicated a complex and highly coupled system; a sparsely-populated matrix a less complex one.\nClumps of strong interactions (note the rows and columns may be rearranged at will to achieve\nthis clumping) may indicate coupled physics and may suggest computational modules.\nThe rows and columns are summed. The sums on the attributes show how strongly they are\naffected by the design variables; a very low sum indicates the attribute is not sufficiently affected\nby the design vector and either the attribute is inappropriate or the design vector should be\nmodified to more strongly affect it. The sums on the design variables indicate their impact on\nthe attributes; again, a low number is a flag that either the design variable is non-discriminating,\nor that an attribute is missing. The latter can happen when the team's physical intuition for the\nproblem (understanding that a design variable should affect the outcome) exceeds their\nfunctional intuition (understanding what function of the outcome would vary with the design\nvariable).\nAs this step is informational, the process should be modified to suit the problem. First order\neffects can be accentuated by using a 9-3-1-0 scoring system instead of 9-6-3-0; this is useful for\nlarger attribute-design vector sets where first order effects must be emphasized. If an interaction\nis truly unknown, (but suspected to be non-zero) a special notation can be made on the chart to\nindicate further study is required. The choice of attributes on rows and design variables on\ncolumns is fairly arbitrary (previous MATE studies have used the opposite convention to the one\nused here). The present convention is suggested so that a \"house of quality\" (see Reference 39,\nAppendix A) can be built over the design variables to study their interactions with each other.\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\n5.10.\nX-TOS attribute-design vector mapping\nDesign Vars\nPerigee\nApogee\nDelta-V\nPropulsion\nInclination\nComm System\nAnt.

Data lifespan and sample altitude are\ndetermined primarily by the orbital mechanics and the delta-V capability necessary to maintain\norbits. Diversity of latitudes and time at the equator are determined primarily by orbital\ninclination. Latency is primarily a function of the communication system. Mission scenario\n(how many vehicles are launched, when, into what orbits) affects most attributes very strongly.\nThe totals indicate that data lifespan is impacted by many of the design variables and may be the\nmost discriminating of the attributes. (In hindsight, this proved to be the case). Diversity of\nlatitudes, on the other hand, is impacted strongly by only two variables, and so will be easy to\ncompute. It may well still be discriminating, as it has two strong interactions. The design\nvariable totals show the orbital elements and mission scenario having more effect than the\nvehicle design parameters. Propulsion and power systems, in particular, look like they may have\nonly weak effects. Intuition suggests that the propulsion system choice should have a stronger\neffect. In hindsight, its effect was diminished by the choice of delta-V as a design variable,\ninstead of a more physical parameter such as fuel load. The power system affects data lifespan\nthrough its own lifespan, and latency via its ability to provide sufficient power; this suggests\nthat power system modeling could be made very simple, concentrating only on these two aspects.\nFigure 17 X-TOS attribute-design vector mapping\n„ 2003 Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n11/6/03\n\nALPHA DRAFT- For Review Only\n5.11.\nSpace Tug attribute-design vector mapping\nDesign Vars\nPropulsion System\nFuel Load\nEquipment Mass\nTotal Impact\nAttributes\nDelta-V\n9 27\nResponse Time\n1 11\nEquipment Capability\nTotal\n18 10 19\nCost\nTotal w/Cost\n27 19 28\nThis rather simple map organizes the known interactions.

      "content": "Autonomous Flight Control and\nSoftware Literature Review\n16.886 - Aircraft Systems Architecting\nPaul Mitchell\nFebruary 25, 2004\n\n16.886\nAircraft Systems Architecting\nFebruary 25, 2004\nOverview\nGuidance Approaches\nString Stability\nAutopilot & Software Capabilities\nReferences\n\n16.886\nAircraft Systems Architecting\nFebruary 25, 2004\nGuidance Approaches-1\nLeader-Follower Station Keeping\nz\nTry to maintain position relative to\nother aircraft.\nz\nDesired relative static position based\non theoretical/experimental vortex\ncalculations.\nz\n2 methods:\nz\n\"Leader Mode\" [6]\nz\n\"Front Mode\" [5,6,8,10,11,13,14,16,17]\nTrajectory Tracking [7, 11]\nz\nMaintain position relative to a set great\ncircle trajectory.\nFormation Geometry Center [7]\nz\nBalances deviations from pre-\ndetermined formation geometry and\nplanned trajectory.\nz\nMaintains geometry through FGC.\n1.\nLeader-Follower Station Keeping\nThis is the standard guidance method that was first presented by Greg Larson earlier this month. There has been a lot of literature written\non this method, starting with Hummel and constantly improved upon by others such as Lavretsky, Guilietti with adaptive control\nmethods. Through NASA's AFF program, this is the only guidance method from my list proven to work in actual manned formation\nflight. In this method the control algorithm tries to maintain a static position relative to another aircraft in the formation. This static\nposition is pre-determined, either by aerodynamic theory (relatively undeveloped) or experimental data (expensive). There are two\ntypes of station keeping, \"leader mode\", where each aircraft maintains a relative position to a designated leader aircraft, and the more\ncommonly investigated \"front\" mode where relative position is held in the vortex of the wingman (men?) directly ahead of the\ntrailing aircraft. The wingman directly ahead of a trailing aircraft may coincide with the formation leader, but this isn't necessarily so\nas formation numbers rise above 3. As we are primarily concerned with staying in the vortex of the aircraft directly ahead, \"front\"\nmode seems to make a lot of sense. However, [6] makes a valid point in that string stability may become an issue with the \"front\"\nmode that is less of a problem than in \"leader\" mode. More on that later.\n2. Trajectory Tracking\nThis is another method presented by Greg Larson. It's pretty simple and is appropriate if you have a set trajectory with no arbitrary\nmaneuvers. Trajectories are defined ahead of time relative to one another, and the algorithm tries to maintain those set paths. This\nisn't investigated in the literature too much for some reason, but I can see benefits to using it. It certainly is easy to do from a control\nstandpoint and doesn't require accurate relative position measurements. However, it is also the most inflexible method.\n3. Formation Geometry Center\nThis concept is based off of observation of the natural flight behavior of birds that maintain a defined geometrical shape, but if one or more\nof the birds loses its position in the formation, the flock waits (or holds back) for those birds to rejoin the formation. The original\ntrajectory is modified to accomplish this. So this algorithm tries to maintain formation geometry (thus, relative positions can be\nmaintained) while at the same time tracking a prescribed path for each aircraft. If an aircraft loses its position, the formation senses\nit, acts together to restore geometry, then moves back to tracking the correct path. This combines pure trajectory tracking with a\nvariant of the station-keeping concept. The formation geometry center (FGC) is an imaginary point that depends on the integral of\nthe average of formation speeds, headings and flight path angles. The geometry center concept could be implemented independently.\nOnly simulations were done and only with 2 aircraft in standard V-formation, with good results.\n\n16.886\nAircraft Systems Architecting\nFebruary 25, 2004\nGuidance Approaches-2\nNeural Networks [5, 15]\nz\nAlgorithm that is \"trained\" by presenting it examples\nof input and corresponding desired output.\nz\nExample: Train NN to tell you relative position based\non wake effects trail aircraft experiences [15].\nPerformance/Extremum Seeking [2,4,11,12]\nz\nObjective to minimize a performance measure such\nas pitch angle or thrust/drag.\nz\nUses dither signal or NN to determine performance\ngradient.\nVortex Shaping\nz\nChange leader's wing configuration to move vortex\nwhere trailing aircraft is rather than other way around.\nH-Infinity Methods [5]\nz\nFrequency response shaping of MIMO systems to\nmeet system performance and stability parameters.\nControl-Configured Vehicles\nz\nUses direct lift/side-force to make corrections, no\nroll/pitch.\nz\nMakes sure vortex locations don't vary as much over\ntime.\nSource: http://www.ft.bs.dlr.de/flugsystemtechnik/history/roadmap_e.htm\n1.\nNeural Networks\nNeural Networks are software programs that have the ability to be trained by presenting the program examples of input and the corresponding desired output.\nNN are receiving a lot of attention in many different areas, primarily NOT in formation flight, but it has been tried in very limited simulation. [15]\npresents a framework for getting a NN to tell you relative position based upon the wake effects the trail aircraft is feeling and shows that it is possible\nin practice. Care must be taken to have an excellent training set for good results. Also mentioned in [5] by Boeing as an area for possible development\nin the NASA AFF project.\n2. Performance/Extremum Seeking\nThe objective of this algorithm is to minimize a performance parameter, in formation flight typically the trailing aircraft's trim pitch angle or thrust. It does\nnot need to know any information about a vortex model. This area is still quite under-developed and most theory [2,4] places the aircraft near the\ndesired position, then moves opposite the gradient of the measured performance function. This requires the introduction of a dither (periodic) signal\nfor the system to sense the gradient, which is highly undesirable. Other methods using neural networks to \"sense\" the gradient have also been tried\n[12]. Simulations have been done with 2 F/A-18s [12] and C5s [2] in formation, but no flight tests as yet.\n3. Vortex Shaping\nThis is an idea that has come up in discussion with MIT & Stanford professors such as Murman, Deyst, etc. but I have not been able to find any literature thus\nfar on this method being investigated. What this would involve would be some sort of manipulation of the wingtips/wings of the aircraft creating the\nvortices so that the vortices themselves move instead of the trailing aircraft, ie. we bring the vortex to the aircraft instead of the other way around. It's\ndefinately a different way to look at things. Major limitations I can see: Would require non-trivial (structural) changes to the expensive wings on\nexisting aircraft, plus we really don't have a good enough model of the wake of an aircraft to be able to predict with enough accuracy where aircraft\nchanges will move the vortices.\n4. H-Infinity Methods\nThis is a relatively new control method that takes performance and stability goals for the system and translates them into limits on the infinity norm of the\ntransfer function for the MIMO system. The frequency response of the system is manipulated to achieve desired results. I don't know how exactly this\napplies to formation flight, but I included it as it was mentioned as a possible future direction in [5] for the NASA AFF project.\n5. Control-Configured Vehicles\nThis is not so much it's own separate method of guidance for formation flight as a way to possibly complete in-flight adjustments more efficiently. This\nwould involve utilizing direct lift and side force actuators to accomplish lateral and vertical motions to correct small errors in position. Doing so\nwould mean that trailing vortices would not move up or down due to pitch or roll. We don't yet know the effects of pitching/rolling to correct and how\nmuch it is possibly costing in fuel economy as opposed to this method. Using this method, auxiliary engines could be used that are designed for finer\nadjustments that would use less fuel overall. Control-configured vehicles have been utilized in other applications such as UAVs, but not for formation\nflight to my knowledge. The picture to the right is Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jet Direct Side Force Control (DSFC) demonstrator aircraft of the German\nAir Force.\n\n16.886\nAircraft Systems Architecting\nFebruary 25, 2004\nString Stability\nA measure of how errors propagate\nthrough a series of interconnected\nsystems.\nIn formation flight, string stability is\ndetermined by whether position\nerrors get larger as they move down\nthe chain.\nWell explored topic in Intelligent\nVehicle Highway Systems (IVHS)\n[18]. Key is knowing intent.\nNASA AFF project found V\nformation of 7 F/A-18s string\nunstable yet had acceptable\nperformance using their derived\nalgorithms [1].\nLimiting factor was ride quality.\nString Stability\nString stability is a measure of how errors propagate through a series of interconnected\nsystems. In the case of formation flight, string stability is determined by whether position\nerrors in the front of the formation get larger or smaller as they move down the chain. This\nis a topic that has been well explored in the IVHS program. The results out of that program\nare that string stability can be achieved with constant separation distance if each vehicle\nknows the relative velocity or position of the lead vehicle AND the one in front (may be the\nsame). If separation distance can vary with speed, then only the absolute velocity of the\nvehicle and the relative velocity of the vehicle in front are required. [18] hypothesizes that\nthese same requirements will result in string stability of formation flight as well, though\nthere are complicating factors. [1] experiments with a string unstable system and gets\nresults that say that string instability may be OK, especially for smaller formations. For\nexample, in the graphs to the side demonstrate a simulation of F/A-18 aircraft in light\nturbulence with the last aircraft still mostly staying within the project goal of within 9ft\nrelative position accuracy. Limitation comes in when you consider the accelerations that\nthe pilots experience. A measure of this is the \"ride quality\" given by the motion sickness\ndose values (MSDV) issued by the ISO. MSDV is a frequency-weighted acceleration in the\nz-direction. It can be seen that with all the more aggressive gain sets we get above the limit\nset on the graph, which is where 10 percent of the general population would vomit after an\nhour of flight in those conditions.\n\n16.886\nAircraft Systems Architecting\nFebruary 25, 2004\nAutopilot & Software Capabilities\nAutopilots exist able to perform\ncommon formation maintenance\ntasks\nz\nForm-up/Break-up\nz\nUse of large reference position signals,\netc.\nz\nWhen it is optimal for vehicles to join\nand leave a formation, or enter into\none at all?\nz\nAircraft node change and formation\nreconfiguration [6]\nz\n\"Equal power\" formation [3]\nz\nAircraft loss or gain\nMid-air collision avoidance still a\nconcern [5]\nz\nFor now, ultimately up to the pilot to\nmaintain adequate separation.\nz\nFF autopilot to disengage if separation\nor rate min/max are exceeded.\nSoftware must be multi-string\n(redundant) and generally have\ntighter restrictions on accuracy than\ncurrent systems.\nAutopilots can do just about everything we want in formation flying. For form up, a pilot\ncould activate a formation flying autopilot which would track to a specific point relative to\nanother aircraft, provided to begin with the two planes were close enough. To leave a\nformation, pilots could specify a new relative position outside the formation before taking\nthe controls. Rough algorithms in simulation also have been able to perform more\ndynamical tasks such as switching leaders in a formation (as described in Multhopp for\n\"equal power\" formation) and changing formation geometry when the number of aircraft in\nthe formation changes due to one leaving or joining up. On the right you can see a\nsimulation of this sort of thing happening where the leader of the formation drops out the\nback and the formation adjusts to compensate for this, with another aircraft becoming the\nnew leader.\nSoftware is not up to flight critical standards for formation flight just yet. As such (and\neven when it is), mid-air collision is always a concern. Warnings can be provided to the\npilot and the formation flight autopilot can disengage automatically when minimum\nseparation distances or maximum separation rates passed. The normal airplane autopilot\ncan still be engaged at this point if desired. Indeed, this was exactly the case for the NASA\nAFF project. In order to prevent system failures, redundancy needs to be build into the\nsoftware.\n\n16.886\nAircraft Systems Architecting\nFebruary 25, 2004\nReferences\n[1]\nAllen, M.J., Ryan, J., Hanson, C.E., and Parle, J.F., \"String Stability of a Linear Formation Flight Control System,\" AIAA Paper\n2002-4756, Aug. 2002.\n[2]\nBinetti, P., Ariyur, K.B., Krstic, M., and Bernelli, F., \"Formation Flight Optimization Using Extremum Seeking Feedback,\" AIAA\nJournal of Guidance, Control and Dynamics, Vol. 26, No. 1, 2003, pp.132-142.\n[3]\nBlake, W.B., and Multhopp, D., \"Design, Performance and Modeling Considerations for Close Formation Flight,\" AIAA Paper 98-\n4343, Aug. 1998.\n[4]\nChichka, D.F., Speyer, J.L., and Park, C.G., \"Peek Seeking Control with Application to Formation Flight,\" Proceedings of the 38th\nIEEE Conference on Decision and Control, pp. 2463-2470, Phoenix, AZ, Dec. 1999.\n[5]\nCobleigh, B., \"Capabilities and Future Applications of the NASA Autonomous Formation Flight (AFF) Aircraft,\" AIAA Paper 2002-\n3443, May 2002.\n[6]\nGuilietti, F., Pollini, L., and Innocenti, M., \"Autonomous Formation Flight,\" IEEE Controls System Magazine, Vol. 20, No. 6, 2000,\npp. 34-44.\n[7]\nGuilietti, F., Pollini, L., and Innocenti, M., \"Formation Flight Control: A Behavioral Approach,\" AIAA Paper 2001-4239, Aug. 2001.\n[8]\nHanson, C.E., Ryan, J., Allen, M.J., and Jacobson, S.R., \"An Overview of Flight Test Results for a Formation Flight Autopilot,\"\nAIAA Paper 2002-4755, Aug. 2002.\n[9]\nHouck, S., and Powell, J.D., \"Visual, Cruise Formation Flying Dynamics,\" AIAA Paper 2000-4316, Aug. 2000.\n[10]\nHummel, D., \"The Use of Aircraft Wakes to Achieve Power Reduction in Formation Flight,\" Proceedings of the Fluid Dynamics\nPanel Symposium, AGARD, 1996, pp. 1777-1794.\n[11]\nLarson, G., \"Autonomous Formation Flight,\" Presentation to MIT 16.886 Class, 05 Feb. 2004.\n[12]\nLavretsky, E., Hovakimyan, N., Calise, A., and Stepanyan, V., \"Adaptive Vortex Seeking Formation Flight Neurocontrol,\" AIAA\nPaper 2003-5726, Aug. 2003.\n[13]\nLavretsky, E., \"F/A-18 Autonomous Formation Flight Control System Design,\" AIAA Paper 2002-4757, Aug. 2002.\n[14]\nMisovec, K. \"Applied Adaptive Techniques for F/A-18 Formation Flight,\" AIAA Paper 2002-4550, Aug. 2002.\n[15]\nPollini, L., Guilietti, F., and Innocenti, M., \"Sensorless Formation Flight,\" AIAA Paper 2001-4356, Aug. 2001.\n[16]\nProud, A.W., Pachter, M., and D'Azzo, J.J., \"Close Formation Flight Control,\" Proceedings of the AIAA Guidance, Navigation and\nControl Conference, pp. 1231-1246, Portland, OR, Aug. 1999.\n[17]\nSchumacher, C.J., and Singh, S.N., \"Nonlinear Control of Multiple UAVs in Close-Coupled Formation Flight,\" AIAA Paper 2000-\n4373, Aug. 2000.\n[18]\nWolfe, J.D., Chichka, D.F., and Speyer, J.L., \"Decentralized Controllers for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Formation Flight,\" AIAA\nPaper 96-3833, Jul. 1996.\nReferences for further depth on the material that was just presented."

      "content": "Commercial Cargo Needs,\nMarket, and Metrics\nDan Morales\n16.886, MIT\n25 February 2004\n\nOverview\n- Current state of the market\n- Predicted market growth\n- Predicted air cargo fleet growth\n- Air Cargo Airlines\n- System issues\n- Risk / Constraints\n\nCurrent State\n- Most economic models show large correlation\nbetween air cargo growth and economic growth\n- Multiple factors have led to the current crisis:\n- Economic slowdown in US/Europe\n- Sept 11\n- Increased security costs\n- Reduction of information technology/high-tech\nequipment sales\n- SARS virus\n- Geopolitical conflict\n- Falling yields, integrator expansion, and\nconsolidations of freight forwarders\nMost economic models have shown an extremely high correlation between the air\ncargo growth and economic growth, as measured by GDP. There are other drivers\nsuch as globalization and lean inventory strategies, but the economic downturn is\nprobably the biggest reason that the air cargo industry has been suffering through a\nhuge recent crisis.\nThis crisis was caused by multiple factors. Around the year 2000, the economic\nslowdown in the US as well as in Europe preceded the terrorist attacks on Sept 11th,\nwhich then led to increased security costs. The reduction of information\ntechnology/high-tech equipment sales also put a small dent in air cargo. The recent\noutbreak of the SARS virus along with the plethora of conflicts that have plagued\nthe 21st century so far were also key ingredients in forming the current crisis.\nIn addition, falling yields, the expansion of integrated express carriers, and the\nconsolidation of freight forwarders have all been recent trends in the air cargo\nindustry.\n\n-World GDP will average 3.2% growth per year\n-World air cargo traffic will grow at 6.4% per year\nHowever, most major market forecasters predict that world GDP will make a strong\nrecovery, which will then of course be the impetus for strong recovery in the air\ncargo market. The predictions for the next twenty years are for world GDP to grow\non average 3.2% per year and for world air cargo traffic to grow on average 6.4%\nper year.\n\nRegional Growth\n-Asia growing fastest; mature markets growing slower\nNow here is a chart of the top ten air freight markets in the next twenty years\naccording to the Global Market Forecast produced by Airbus. As is evident, the\nfastest growing markets are those linking Asia to other regions as well as Intra Asia\nwhereas the domestic US market and other maturing markets will grow much more\nslowly.\n\nRegional Growth\n- US share of world market will drop from 30.4% to 26.1% by\n- Asia's GDP share will grow from 24.7% to 26.3%\n- Domestic China will grow at 10.3% per year, or possibly\n11.2% per year (depending on source)\n- Intra-Asia will grow at 8.4%, Asia-North America will grow\nat 7.5%, and Europe-Asia at 7.0%\n- Fastest growing air freight markets are those connecting\nAsia-Pacific to Europe and North America\n- 7/10 top flows serve this region\n- Together, they will represent 40% of world air cargo in 20 years and\nwill form the majority of the demand for long range cargo airplanes\n-So, to break that down a little further, the US share of the world market is currently\n30.4% and will decrease to 26.1% by 2021.\n-Asia's share of world GDP will instead grow from 24.7% to 26.3%.\n-Domestic China, one of the top future markets, will grow at 10.3% per year or\npossibly even 11.2% depending on which source is used.\n-The Intra-Asia market will grow at the fastest rate of all Asian markets, around\n8.4%. The Asia-North America market will grow at 7.5%, and the Europe-Asia\nmarket will grow at 7.0%.\n-So what can we conclude from all of these numbers? Essentially, the fastest\ngrowing air freight markets are those connecting the Asia-Pacific region to Europe\nand North America. 7 out of the top ten markets serve this region, as you saw on\nthe previous chart, and together, they will represent 40% of the world air cargo\nmarket in 20 years and will be the basis for the demand for long range cargo\nairplanes.\n\nAir Cargo Fleet\n-World freighter fleet will double by 2020\n-Not including passenger aircraft system\nIn response, the world freighter fleet will more than double by the year 2020,\naccording to most predictions, going from an estimated 1,540 in the year 2000 to\n3,338 dedicated freighters in the year 2020.\n-About 395 of those will be ones retained in service throughout those\n20 years.\n-About 940 of those will be passenger airplanes converted to cargo\nones to replace old or faulty planes.\n-205 will be new freighters for replacements, and 501 will be new\nfreighters for growth.\n-Finally, 1,297 will be conversions for growth of the industry to meet\nthe increasing demand.\nJust to let you know, these numbers are all for dedicated cargo airplanes. This\ndoes not include the passenger aircraft system, which in the year 2000 carried 48%\nof the global airfreight traffic, and is projected to carry 43% of that traffic in 2020.\n\nAircraft Size\n- Most new production freighters will be large aircraft\n- In 2020, intermediate size (regional) freighters will still dominate the\nmarket\n-To be able to support such a large increase in traffic, Airbus predicts that future\nfreighters will need to be utilized much more often and that they will grow in size,\nincrease capacity per aircraft, and thus achieve lower unit operating costs. The\ncatch, as Prof Clarke pointed out, is that larger aircraft are nice only if you can fill\nthem up all the way.\n-However, even though a majority of new production freighters will be large aircraft,\nthe intermediate or regional size of aircraft will still comprise the majority of the\nactual market. In this table, you can see the breakdown of cargo planes into 4\ndifferent segments: The feeders, the regional freighters, the long range freighters,\nand the really large freighters.\n\nAir Cargo Airlines\n- Federal Express\n- Lufthansa Airlines\n- Singapore Airlines\n- Korean Air\n- Air France\nThey have been unable to penetrate the\nlong haul high-end trucking market or the\nhigh-end sea cargo market.\n- Federal Express\n- UPS Airlines\n- United Airlines\n- Northwest Airlines\n- American Airlines\nInternational:\nDomestic:\n-It is also necessary to what airlines are out there doing this right now. You can see\nthe top 5 international carriers as well as the top 5 domestic ones.\n-Whether it's designing an entirely new large freight transportation vehicle or using\nexisting aircraft to fly formation to save on fuel costs, or possibly even some\ncombination, it has not been accomplished. I'm sure you all remember the letter I\nread to you from FedEx outlining the desired specifications. They seemed pretty\ntough to meet, but then again, I guess that's part of the challenge.\n\nAir Cargo System\n- Sea transport takes 99% of cargo market and leaves only\n1% for air transportation (by weight)\n- Opposite for passenger transport\n- Capture the top 1% or 2% of sea transport and cause a\nlarge growth in the air freight market\n- Multiple factors involved:\n- Production and distribution are interconnected\n- Difficult to quantify supply and demand\n- Depreciation of shipped goods - TIME!\n- Total Distribution Cost (TDC) = Transport Cost + Holding Inventory\n- Transport Cost = DOC + IOC = Cargo Rate\n- Choose an aircraft type based on our mission design and cargo rate\n- Minimize cost per ton-mile\n-So we need to look at it from an overall viewpoint. Sea transport is currently responsible for 99% of\nthe cargo market whereas air cargo takes only 1%. Conversely, those numbers are the exact\nopposite for passenger transport. Thus, the two markets, people and cargo, are significantly\ndifferent, and so the systems that transport both are significantly different as well.\n-As a class, our job would be to capture that top 1 or 2% of the sea transport and cause a large\ngrowth in the air freight market.\n-However, there are multiple factors involved in setting up such a system. I will give a few of them\nhere, but I'm sure there are hundreds more. First of all, the production and the distribution of goods\nare inherently an interconnected architecture. Unfortunately, it is quite difficult to quantify supply and\ndemand in this market because of the lack of comprehensive sources of data, carriers that provide\ncargo and passenger capacity, and many other issues. Another key component of the air cargo\nsystem is depreciation - that the goods being shipped lose value the more time it takes to deliver\nthem. Time is such an important factor in a system such as this. This concept of just-in-time delivery\nof products is in increasing demand because a huge chunk of potential profit is lost when goods are\nnot delivered in time to catch the right fad, for new orders, or for replacements. And carriers that can\nprovide such rapid delivery can also charge a premium to increase their revenue. So time in this\nissue is paramount. An extremely simple model would equate the total distribution cost with the\ntransport cost and the cost of holding onto inventory. The transport cost could be further broken\ndown into the direct operating cost, like fuel and maintenance, and the indirect operating cost, like\ncargo handling and administration. That sum is also called the cargo rate. We would want to pick an\naircraft based on our mission design and that cargo rate, and our main goal would be to minimize this\ntotal cost per ton mile. If we could do this to such an extent that significant savings could be\ndemonstrated over a certain period of time, then we would be in business.\n\nRisk / Constraints\n- Economic\n- Bankruptcy, regional or world economy deterioration,\nsupply chain problems...\n- Political\n- War, govt. changes, terrorism, privatization...\n- Disasters\n- Weather, disease...\n- Regulatory\n- Taxes, policy changes...\n- Internal\n- Forecast error, strike, plain crash...\nOne final item that has not been discussed is the risk associated with maintaining a\ntransportation system of this nature. You might also call these constraints. There\nare the economic risks of economy deterioration, supply chain problems, and other\nthings. There are political risks such as war, government changes, terrorism.\nNatural disasters can certainly cause problems. Regulatory decisions to impose\ntaxes or change certain policies can also have a profound effect on our system.\nFinally, internal risks such as our planes crashing into each other while flying in\nformation must certainly be taken into account.\n\nQuestions?\n\nReferences\n-\nAirbus Global Market Forecast, Sept 2002, available at\nhttp://www.airbus.com/pdf/media/gmf2001.pdf\n-\nBarkowski, R.
