What makes one material different from another? How do properties as diverse as how something tastes to how it behaves in a magnetic field all depend on its chemistry? And how can we manipulate these chemical properties to create new and better uses for these materials?\n\nIn this course, we explore what makes things in the world the way they are and why, to understand the science and consider the engineering. We learn not only why the physical world behaves the way it does, but also how to think with chemical intuition, which can't be gained simply by observing the macroscopic world. That's because the chemistry of materials is defined by the interactions between building blocks too small to see or interact with. We encourage you to develop a sense for what's going on in the objects around us at the atomic and molecular scale, which is key to understanding the world as it is and redesigning the world that could be.\n\n\"\nWhy This Matters\n\" is a brief portion of each lecture focusing on how the topic covered relates to important innovations (and sometimes unexpected consequences) in science and in life, demonstrating real world applications, and suggesting creative directions for research.\n\nWho Should Take This Course?\n\n3.091 is for students with anywhere from little to no chemistry background to those with three years of high school chemistry. The first couple of weeks cover introductory material from the periodic table, moles and stoichiometry, and balancing chemical reactions to Lewis structures and molecular shapes. We then dive into more chemistry of the solid-state, from molecular orbitals and intermolecular forces to semiconductors, doping, metals, crystallography, x-rays, defects, glasses, kinetics, aqueous solutions, acids and bases, polymers, electrochemistry, and diffusion.\n\nTextbook\n\nThe main text for this course is:\nGeneral Chemistry: Principles, Patterns, and Applications\nby Bruce Averill and Patricia Eldredge. It is available to purchase in various formats on\nFlatWorld\n. This book is also available from\nthe Open Textbook Library\nfor free under a CC BY-NC-SA license.\n\nHomework\n\nHomework consists of (a) weekly practice problems from the textbook and (b) hands on problems via \"Goodie Bags\" distributed during the semester. Goodie Bags (GB's) are mini-experiment kits that allow students to explore a key concept and solve related problems.\n\nOne week after distribution, in recitation, students take a 15-minute quiz that includes material learned in lecture, in recitation, from the textbook, and through the GB problems. The quiz scores will count as the \"homework\" portion of the cumulative grade in the subject. At the end of term, the lowest quiz score will be dropped from the average. Note that while the practice problems and GB problems are not collected or graded, if you do not do them, you are very unlikely to pass the weekly quiz.\n\nExams\n\nThere are three (3) exams and a final exam in this course (see\nExams and Quizzes section\n). The final exam takes place during the Final Exam Period.\nDo not leave town until after your last final.\n\nGrading\n\nFirst-year students\n: Pass/No Record (Institute requirement for Pass is C-level or better)\n\nUpper-level students\n: A (85%+), B (70-84%), C (50-69%), D (45-49%), F (0-44%)\n\nPassing grade (C-level) ≥ 50% absolute (no grading on a curve)\n\nFinal grade: 25% quizzes, 15% each for three exams, 30% final exam\n\nHow to Succeed in 3.091\n\nOur focus is on teaching fundamental concepts of solid-state chemistry as a basis for learning the material, combined with problems related to these concepts and hands-on materials. If you are engaged in these aspects of class and make sure to keep up with the homework and quizzes, then you will do well on the exams.\n\nDon't skip the quizzes, even if you feel you know next to nothing about the subject! The only way to get a zero is to not take the quiz. A low grade is better than no grade. You also may find you know more than you do and get a better score than you may have thought you would.\n\nAlso, show your work; since our goal in giving quizzes rather than problem sets is to find out what you know, if you show your thought process in coming up with an answer, it's possible you may receive partial credit even if the answer is incorrect.\n\nOur goal is to turn students into scholars. Students may do \"rote\" learning to pass tests, but scholars learn in order to explore uncharted territory, to discover answers for themselves, to push boundaries, and to see what lies beyond. We believe that chemistry is both fascinating to study as a science and personally compelling for its potential to open doors to engineering solutions that improve the world around us.\n\nAdditional Resources\n\nIf you find you need a refresher of high school chemistry to help lay the foundation, these free resources may help:\n\nKhan Academy: Chemistry\n\nUdemy.com: Chemistry\n\nCMU Chemistry",

For each lecture, there is a summary of the main topics covered, the Why This Matters\nmoment, and the new Why This Employs section, plus a few example problems. These handouts\nwill be given by \"Unit,\" which is the content that goes into each exam. There's also a Concept Map\nat the beginning of each Unit, to show how the various materials are connected together.\nSo why did we make this? We hope it's useful to get a good snapshot of any given lecture. Whether\nyou couldn't make it to a lecture or you couldn't stop thinking about a lecture, this is a way to\nquickly get a sense of the content. It also gives me a chance to provide additional details that I\nmay not have time for in the Why This Matters example, and also it lets me try out the Why This\nEmploys section, which I certainly will not have time to discuss much in the lecture. Hopefully you\nfind it useful, and as with anything else in this class, any and all feedback is most welcome!\nOne point about these lecture summaries. Please note that the lecture summaries are not meant to\nbe a substitute for lecture notes. If you were to only read these summaries and not go to lecture, yes\nyou'd get a good sense of the lecture from a very high level view, but no, you wouldn't get enough\nout of it for it to be your only resource to learn the material!\n\nHow This Connects: Unit 1, Lectures 1-9\nIn this class we have 36 lectures, 20 recitations, 9 goodie bags, and 12 problem sets, all tightly\nintegrated and each one designed to contribute to your overall 3.091 learning experience. These\ndifferent resources come together in the Celebrations of Learnings throughout the semester, includ\ning 9 quizzes, 3 midterms, and a final exam. For each unit, defined as the content that goes into\na midterm, we have created a Concept Map to elucidate connections between the different class\ncomponents so that you can see clearly the context of each.\nBelow is an image of the Exam 1 Concept Map. This demonstrates how each of the aspects of\nthe course fit together: you have lots of resources! The Practice Problems, Recitations, Goodie\nBags, and Lectures are ungraded resources to help you prepare for the quizzes and exams. All of\nthe material listed on this concept map is fair game for Exam 1.\n\nLecture 1: Introduction and the chemistry of the periodic\ntable\nSummary\n\"Never trust an atom, they make everything up,\" is a classic chemistry joke that also happens to be\nso true, but if we want to know which elements comprise our materials of interest, then we need to\nknow how these elements interact with one another, how they are structured, and how the material\nwas processed to achieve this structure. To truly answer these questions, investigators in the last\nfew centuries have made use of the scientific method. This involves asking questions, gathering\nand examining evidence, identifying explanations, and re-testing.\nOne of the most exciting questions in the history of chemistry was that of the atom--Democritus\nand Leucippus hypothesized indivisible building blocks of the universe (though now we know that\natoms can be broken down into even smaller \"subatomic particles\"). Robert Boyle, in his quest to\nidentify different atoms, studied metal ores (naturally occurring rocks containing metal impurities)\nand succeeded in separating a large number of elements, including many metals. As the list of\ndiscovered atoms grew, scientists also began studying their categorization. For example, Antoine\nLavoisier named four property-based categories for the 33 elements he identified: Gases, Non-Metals,\nMetals, and Earths. John Dalton identified 36 different elements, and designed a graphical symbol\nto represent each of them.\nIn this lecture we introduced the concept of chemical reaction balancing, which involves adding\ncoefficients to the reactants and/or products in the reaction to ensure that there are equal numbers\nof each type of atom on the left- and right-hand sides of the arrow. This is necessary because of\nthe law of conservation of mass, which states that nothing is created or destroyed at the atomic\nlevel, so the mass of the reactants equals the mass of the products. Rather, atoms can be rearranged\nto form different molecules. The first chemical reaction we balanced was a combustion reaction,\nwhich is a reaction in which a carbonaceous material burns in the presence of oxygen. We found the\nlimiting reagent for this reaction, which is the reacting species (atom or molecule) that is used up\nfirst. The yield of the reaction is the amount of product formed.\nDalton stated that atoms of a given element have a particular weight and other distinguishing\ncharacteristics. He proposed the law of multiple proportions, which says that when two elements\nreact to form a series of compounds, the ratios of masses of the 2nd element per gram to the 1st can\nbe expressed as ratios of integers.\nWhy this matters\nIn this first lecture, we started talking about the discovery of the elements. Well, I don't mean\nto give anything away, but there aren't going to be all that many of them in the end. In fact, to\ndate we've got 118 on the official roster, but if we consider which ones we can use to make stuff\nfor humans that number is lower, more like 80 or 90. How many elements do you think there\nare in your cell phone? It depends on the phone, but in mine there are 64 different elements!\n\nThat's more than two thirds of all of the ones we could even have used and it's incredible to think\nabout. Because of this massive design potential, the world we live in has completely changed.\nAs a Materials Scientist, I love that we have this\ntradition (shout out to Danish scholar Christian\nJ. Thomsen) of naming the age we live in by the\nmaterial that mattered most during that age.\nBut as a Materials Scientist, I also love that\nwe'll never be able to do that again. The reason\nis that we truly live in a new era, one where we\ncan realize the dream of Richard Feynman, who\nin his famous speech \"There's Plenty of Room\nat the Bottom\" put forth the vision for atomic-\nscale design and nanotechnology 30 years ahead\nof its time. Today, we routinely control both\nthe choice of elements as well as their struc\nture as they come together to make materials\ndo things we never thought possible even just\n10 years ago! In other words, we control their\nchemistry at the atomic scale.\nThis gets to why this is so cool (and, you guessed it, why it matters). You see, so many of our\ncurrent global challenges - whether in energy, health, or the environment - have a bottleneck that\noccurs because of the material that makes up a central part of the technology (in some devices it's\ncalled the \"active layer\"). That means that by \"simply\" choosing or making a different material, one\nhas the potential to completely change the properties, cost, and manufacturability of the technology.\nThis is unlike a previous revolution around silicon where we went from a cost of $1 per transistor in\n1965 to $0.00000001 per transistor in 2015. Talk about a learning curve! That was primarily due to\nadvances in processing of the same element, silicon, to get to smaller and smaller components. More\nthan a billion transistors now fit nicely on a single chip. Unlike this dramatic age of silicon, many of\nthe next technology revolutions will rely on changing the material itself: in some cases, completely.\nWe now live in the Materials Design Age, which has come just in time since it converges with very\npressing challenges on a global scale that will rely on new materials to be solved. And this is why\nthe discovery of these elements matters so much. They are our playground and the basis from which\nwe will make the next set of technologies to change the world for the better.\nWhy this employs\nIn this section, we'll discuss how the material in each lecture connects to real jobs. I'm trying it out\nthis year for the first time, and since I likely won't have time to spend on it in lecture, this document\nis the only place you'll find it. In Why This Matters, I passionately believe that each lecture can\nand should be connected to some larger-scale challenge, or innovation, or inspiration. In Why This\nEmploys, my goal is to connect each lecture with a possible field of employment. Similar to Why\nThis Matters, this is not meant to be exhaustive but rather illustrative, to give you another way in\nImages of stone arrows, bronze pot, industrial age,\nplastic bottles, silicon chip (c) sources unknown.

Image\nof atomic design is in the public domain.\n\nwhich the material you're learning has value beyond the classroom and connects to something, in\nthis case a job.\nWe spent half of this first lecture talking about the class structure, not just administratively (what's\ngraded, what's not, etc) but also pedagogically (the different components, how they come together\nto provide a learning experience, etc.). Thinking about how to teach better, and how students\nlearn, and how new technologies should or should not be a part of this, is a wonderfully rich area of\nemployment. If you're interested in learning more, check out MIT's Teaching and Learning Lab or\nsome of the cool initiatives in education like EdX, NEET, or the \"superUROP\" programs.\nAnother employment direction related to this lecture is the discovery of new elements. Here, we\nexamined how the earliest chemists attempted to identify elements. This came down to smashing,\nburning, boiling, reacting, etc. It turns out that's still a thing, only in modern times all this reacting\noccurs with much bigger pieces of equipment and much larger teams of people. The next element\nyet to be discovered (at the time of writing, that would mean the 119th known element) will likely\nnot have a very long lifetime, and will be very difficult to make in large quantities. But pushing the\nboundaries between what we have found naturally and what we can make synthetically as it relates\nto the fundamental building blocks of the universe. . . well, that's a pretty exciting thing to do. And\ngiven the prediction by some that an \"island of stability\" exists for heavier elements that have yet\nto be made, it's possible that an entirely new era of chemistry awaits such discoveries.\nThe last example I'll give for employment relates to the idea of the metal ores that I mentioned\nearlier in this lecture. Remember that this is where Dalton and many others were discovering those\nnew elements. Basically, you take a rock and carefully break it up and viola, you get Fe out of it (ok,\nit's a bit more complicated than that, but that's the idea). It turns out that quite often the metal\natom is locked up pretty tightly in the form of an \"oxide\" (yes, that means bonded to oxygen, but\nwe'll get to that in a few lectures). The point is that extracting metals like aluminum from rocks\ntakes an enormous amount of energy, which means it requires a lot of burning of fossil fuels. What if\nyou could come up with a new, much \"greener\" way to get metals or minerals in their pure form out\nof the rocks from which they originate? This would be a very big deal. Mining metals and minerals\ninvolves massive teams of engineers who cover a wide array of jobs from figuring out where to mine,\nto characterization of the starting materials, to optimizing extraction chemistry, to working on new\nways to do that more efficiently.\nExample Problems\n1. In this lecture, you witnessed my passion for pyrotechnics.\na) Write and balance the chemical reaction for a similar process, the combustion of propane (C3H8).\nb) If you have 500g of propane, how many moles do you have? How many molecules?\n\nSolutions\n1. a)\nC3H8 + 5O2 → 3CO2 + 4H2O\nb) First, find the molar mass of propane.\n3 ∗ 12g/mol + 8 ∗ 1g/mol = 44g/mol\nUse the grams given and the molar mass to convert to moles:\n500/44 = 11.36mol\n\nLecture 2: Counting Atoms and Organizing the Elements\nSummary\nThis chapter, we introduced the concept of the mole. This is a constant number, also referred to as\nAvogadro's number, equal to 6.0221409 × 1023 . The atomic mass units (AMUs) assigned to\nan element are equal to the mass in grams of a mole of atoms of that element. Just as Avogadro's\nnumber is just a number, the AMU is just a mass, and 1 AMU is equal to 1.67377 × 10-24 grams.\nJust like the mole, an AMU is another special unit that chemists use to connect the very small world\nof atoms with the comparatively large world of things we work with. This link between the macro\nand atomic worlds means that by simply measuring the mass of a substance, we can know how many\natoms of that material we have.\nIn class we used the example of the combustion of a candle, otherwise known as the nicely bal\nanced reaction C25H52 + 38O2 → 25CO2 + 26H2O. We used this example to emphasize how the\nconcept of the mole gives us a link between the atomic and macroscopic worlds, between grams and\natoms. We also used this example to re-emphasize the concepts of limiting reagent and yield.\nNext, we focused on organizing the periodic table. Unlike in the last chapter, here organization\nmeans more than coming up with a naming scheme or a simple categorization of the elements, as\nDalton, Lavoisier, and many others had already done. In this lecture what we mean by organization\nis really pattern recognition. Scientists were starting to see patterns emerging among the elements,\nand the more elements were discovered, the more effort was put to understanding these patterns.\nDmitri Mendeleev developed the precursor to today's periodic table. His big breakthrough was\nthat he arranged the then-known (63) elements not just by their mass, but also by the repeating\n(periodic!) patterns he observed in their properties. This led him to leave gaps in the periodic table\nthat would later be filled with newly discovered elements. Because of the periodicity in properties,\nhe could even predict the properties of many as-of-yet undiscovered elements. The rows of your\nperiodic table are called periods, and the columns are called groups. The Main Group Elements\nare those in periods two and three. There is a general trend from metallic to non-metallic elements\nalong the periods. The Transition Elements are in groups 3-12 and periods 4 and 5.\nWhy this matters\nThe population of humans on this planet has seen\na dramatic, exponential growth.\nLet's zoom in on\nwhere the growth really started to kick into high gear.\nSee that uptick, around the early 1900's?\nNotice\nthe massive change in slope. That's when we figured\nout how to make nitrogen in a way that plants can\nuse.\nIn other words, with the discovery that is now known\nas the Haber-Bosch process (named after the German\nPeople vs. time plot (c) Population\nReference Bureau. All rights reserved.\nThis content is excluded from out Creative\nCommons license. For information, see\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu/fairuse.\n\nchemists Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch), the world was able to make fertilizer in the abundance\nneeded to feed billions. The key comes down to something called \"fixing\" nitrogen. Plants need\nnitrogen to grow, but most plants cannot use any of that plentiful 78% N2 that's in the air. Instead,\nthey need it in a form that serves up single N atoms, like ammonia (NH3). SO how can we go from\nN2 to NH3? Easily, with the following chemical reaction:\nN2 + H2 → NH3\nAh, sorry, let's balance that:\nN2 + 3H2 → 2NH3\nThat's better. What Haber and Bosch actually did was develop a catalyst and process that allowed\nthis reaction to be carried out much more efficiently than previously. But catalysis is getting a little\nahead of ourselves. For now, let's focus on the balanced reaction and count some atoms.\nIn 2019, 500 million tons of nitrogen is produced for fertilizer each year using the Haber-Bosch\nprocess. Half of the protein in all human beings on this planet comes from nitrogen that was fixed\nby this process! So here's my question: how long can we continue fixing nitrogen this way? And\nsince the reaction tells us we need both N2 and H2, which one would be the limiting reagent?\nFrom all of our discussion so far in this lecture we know that we can use the periodic table to\ndetermine that 1 mole of NH3 is 17 grams. Just for simplicity, suppose in the future we continue\nneeding to make the same amount we're making today, namely 500 million tons of NH3 per year.\nThere are roughly a million grams per ton, so 500 million tons per year\n500 × 106 × 106 grams\nper year. Dividing by 17 grams per mole, this means we need to make roughly 30 × 1012 moles\nof NH3/year. Given the balanced reaction above, this means we'll need as input to the reaction\n15 × 1012 moles of N2 per year. Now, the mass of the atmosphere is about 5.15 ∗ 1021 grams, of\nwhich 78% is N2, so that makes about 4 × 1021 grams of N2 in the air. And since the atomic mass\nfor a nitrogen atom is 7, then it's 14 for N2 which means there are 14 grams per mole of N2. So the\nnumber of moles available in the atmosphere is 4 × 1021 grams of N2 / 14 grams/mole = 3.5 × 1020\nmoles of N2 in the atmosphere. Well that's good news! Taking 3.5 × 1020 moles of N2 total and\ndividing that by 15 × 1012 moles of N2 needed per year, we find that we could keep at it with the\nHaber-Bosch process of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere for more than 20 million years or so\nbefore using it all up.\nThat's just cool. Think about this: we just went from atom to macroscopic world and it's all\nbecause we have this concept of the mole. But we never really answered the question, namely which\none is the limiting reagent in the reaction, the N2 or the H2? We now know how long N2 will last us\nif we were to use it all up in this reaction, so what's left is to do the same thing for H2. Speaking of\nwhich, where will we even get H2? Certainly not from the air. I'll let you all work through this but\nhere's a hint: the oceans contain a whole lot of water, like more than 1018 tons. Maybe you don't\neven need to do any calculations to figure this out!\n\nWhy this employs\nHow does counting or organizing atoms lead to a job? Well, for one thing we're talking about order,\nprecision, and measurement. After all, Mendeleev's success relied on combining careful measure\nment of properties with precise ordering. This skill is needed for many different jobs. One place with\nmeasurement as its mission is the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Check\nout the tag line in their Materials Measurement Laboratory: \"MML serves as the national reference\nlaboratory for measurements in the chemical, biological and material sciences. Activities range from\nfundamental and applied research to the development and dissemination of certified reference ma\nterials and data to assure the quality of measurement results.\" And that's just one of their many\ndivisions.\nAnother job that comes to mind is one related to the fertilizer discussed in our Why This Mat\nters. The three fundamental constituents of commercial fertilizers used throughout the world are\nnitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. As we know, nitrogen requires fixing. Potassium must be\nobtained in other ways. For example, it comes nicely with chlorine as potassium chloride (KCl),\nbut we'd prefer not to have chlorine in the soil since it can lead to toxicity in the crops and high\nacidity and salinity in the soil. However, getting potassium in other forms is expensive and requires,\nas you might guess, chemistry. To make matters more complicated, both the natural sources for\npotassium and the specific soil needs are highly dependent on geography. For farmers in tropical\nregions in Brazil and some countries in Africa, the soil and rock compositions require fertilizers\nthat better match the chemical needs of plants than are currently available. As a solution, more\nfertilizer is added to achieve as much crop yield as counterparts in the north, but many of the basic\ningredients, especially the potassium, are produced in more northern regions and therefore are much\nmore expensive in the Southern Hemisphere. The need for local, sustainable fertilizing solutions\nto increase yields is urgent! But this is starting to sound more like a second edition of Why This\nMatters and less like a Why This Employs. My point is that the development of fertilizers is a prob\nlem of chemistry, and the world is in desperate need of new solutions. In terms of jobs, this could\nmean becoming something called an \"Analytical Chemist\" which means you apply the principles of\nchemistry to figure out what stuff is made of, what the precise compositions are, how to monitor it,\nmodify it, etc. This could also mean working at a company or research lab that develops cutting\nedge ideas (like recent work on using electrochemistry to make potassium).\n\nExtra practice\n1. Solar cells sometimes contain a titanium (Ti) coating that stops the cell from short-circuiting.\nThe Kroll Process for making titanium metal out of titanium oxide is:\nT iCl4 + Mg → MgCl2 + Ti\na) Balance the reaction.\nb) If you have 50g of both TiCl4 and Mg, what is the limiting reagent in the reaction?\nc) What is the yield of the reaction in grams?\nd) Plot the yield of Ti (g) as a function of increasing Mg available for reaction.\n\nSolutions\n1. a)\nT iCl4 + 2Mg- > 2MgCl2 + Ti\nb) Molar mass of Mg: 24.3 g/mol\nMolar mass of TiCl4: 189.9 g/mol\nFind the moles of each reactant by dividing 50g by the individual molar masses:\n50g/24.3 = 2 mol Mg\n50g/189.9 = 0.3 mol TiCl4\nUse the mole ratio from the balanced reaction (1 mol TiCl4/2 mol Mg) to see how much TiCl4\ncould be used up with the amount of Mg you have available:\n(2mol Mg available)/(2mol Mg/1 mol TiCl4) = 1 mol TiCl4\n1 mol TiCl4 would be used up if we had an endless supply of it with the amount of Mg we have.\nThis amount of TiCl4 is more than the amount we actually have available, meaning that the TiCl4\nwill run out before the Mg. TiCl4 is therefore the limiting reagent.\nc) To calculate the Ti yield of the reaction, we use the ratio of Ti to TiCl4 (because these two\nhave a 1:1 molar ratio) and then convert from moles to grams of Ti:\n0.3 moles of TiCl4 are being used (it's the limiting reagent, so it will be used in its entirety) and\nbecause of the 1:1 molar ratio we know that 0.3 moles of Ti will be produced. Multiply this number\nby the molar mass of Ti:\n0.3 ∗ 47.9g/mol = 14.37g Ti\nd) The plot of Ti grams (on the y axis) vs. Mg grams (on the x axis) starts at 0 and increases\nlinearly until the Ti grams reach 14.37 g, at which point we run out of TiCl4 and the reaction will\nstop.\n\nLecture 3: The Discovery of the Electron and the Structure\nof the Atom\nSummary\nThis lecture began with discussion of ground-breaking experiments that brought the scientific com\nmunity closer to understanding the structure of the atom. These included J.J. Thomson's exper\niments with the cathode ray tube (CRT), which allowed him to find the charge-to-mass ratio of\nelectrons, which he realized were negatively charged particles found in all atoms. Robert Millikan\nwas able to ascertain the mass and the charge of the electron using his oil drop experiment. The\natom was not the most fundamental particle after all, rather it was made of smaller particles like\nelectrons, and as we learn next those smaller things that make up atoms have a structure to them.\nThe electronic structure.\nBuilding on the radiation studies of Marie and Pierre Curie, Ernest Rutherford was able to iden\ntify three types of particles found in radiation: alpha particles, which were large and positively\ncharged, beta particles, which were small and negatively charged, and gamma rays, which didn't\ndeflect or interact with the photographic plate in Rutherford's experiment at all. Rutherford then\nconducted the gold foil experiment, which showed that atoms have positive charge that is localized\nin the core of the atom rather than dispersed among the negative charge, as Thomson had proposed.\nThis positively charged center of the atom is called the nucleus. The positively charged particles\nin the nucleus are called protons. For any neutral atom, the number of protons present must equal\nthe number of electrons present. This number is called the element's atomic number, which is\ndenoted by the letter Z. Except for the case of a neutral hydrogen atom composed of only one\nproton in its nucleus and one electron, all atoms also contain neutrons in their nuclei, which are,\nas the name might suggest, neutrally charged particles. To obtain the mass number of a given\natom, the number of protons and neutrons in that specific nucleus are added together. Atoms of the\nsame element can have different numbers of neutrons. This makes them different isotopes of the\nsame element. To obtain the mass given for each element in your periodic table, a weighted average\nis taken of the mass numbers of that element's naturally occurring stable isotopes. The weight is\nassigned according to the isotopes' percent abundance in nature.\nAfter Rutherford's experiments, there remained the question of how an atom structured in this\nway could be stable. Niels Bohr was the one who postulated that the angular momentum of the\nelectrons in atoms must be quantized, which means that it takes on discrete values. This meant\nthat the electron's energy and distance from the nucleus were quantized as well--the electron can\nonly occupy certain orbits.\nWhy this matters\nThe discovery of the electron led to a profound new understanding of the atom, which in turn led\nto an entirely new theory (quantum mechanics), which in turn led to orbitals, bonding, and the\nbuilding blocks for all of modern chemistry, as we'll see soon. But the discovery of the electron\nalso led to a new capability that revolutionized the world: the ability to paint with electricity. The\n\nphosphor screen that was on the end of Thomson's cathode ray tube was the precursor to television,\nand the beginning of a technological revolution that changed almost every aspect of our lives. TV\nwasn't invented by Thomson himself, but Thomson's discovery of this new fundamental paint brush\n- the electron itself - was crucial for the concept to take off. Look at what the man on the left in\nthis image is holding: it's an early version of a TV, which you can now recognize as a giant cathode\nray tube! John Logie Baird was one of the first to commercialize television sets, selling his first one\nin 1925. You can see the inside of an early TV in the middle picture: note that it was comprised of\na CRT plus a coil to induce a magnetic field - essentially the same setup that Thomson used in his\ngroundbreaking experiments.\nIf electrons were scanned across the phosphor screen fast enough, an image could be painted so\nmany times per second that it looked like motion to the human eye. This was easy to do, be\ncause changing a magnetic field quickly and precisely (to position electrons on the screen) can\nbe achieved with simple electronic circuitry. Over the next generation, electrons became a dom\ninant way to exchange visual information. The chemistry of the screen itself is also essential.\nA 'screen' is actually a phosphor coating that\nwas often put on a piece of glass and was the tar\nget of the electron beam. Phosphor is a broad\nterm for materials that emit light in response to\na stimulus. This act of emitting light is called\nluminescence. It can get confusing since the\nterm \"phosphorescent\" means that the material\nslowly emits light over time after being stim\nulated. A good example of a phosphorescent\nmaterial would be glow-in-the-dark toys, where the stimulus is light, and the phosphor can keep\nglowing for many hours. On the other hand, a \"fluorescent\" material also emits light in response to\na stimulus, but as a quick flash lasting nanoseconds. The term phosphor can refer to either of these,\nbut the coating on the CRT screen and in those early televisions is the fluorescent kind. You can\nimagine why: if it didn't emit light quickly,, the image would have afterglows that lasted for hours,\nwhich wouldn't exactly make for a nice movie-watching experience.\nTo make matters even more confusing, the term phosphor (which as we just established can re\nfer to materials that are phosphorescent or materials that are fluorescent), is not to be confused\nwith the element phosphorus. Phosphorous also emits light, but of a different nature entirely, since\nits glow comes from a chemical reaction (a process called \"chemiluminescence\"). So, to sum up: the\nscreen we're talking about uses a phosphor which is fluorescent, not phosphorescent, and doesn't\nhave any phosphorus in it. Great.\nChemically speaking, what are these phosphors? There are so many different materials that are\nphosphors that it would take an entirely separate book to go through them all. They can be small\nmolecules, complex solids, or liquids. They can emit light in response to many different stimuli, from\nlight to heat to electric fields to the electrons we're discussing here in our CRTs. The first television\nscreens were black and white, so the goal was simply to use phosphors that glowed white when they\nwere struck by electrons. Powders made from zinc, cadmium, and sulfur and a dab of silver were\nMan with CRT & open TV images (c) sources unknown.

In order to achieve color TV, blue, green, and red phosphors were needed. The\nelectron beam could be pointed at whichever ones were needed to make a given color, again using\nthe magnetic field to guide the electrons with fantastic precision. It turned out the green and blue\nphosphors were pretty straightforward to make, zinc-sulfide with a touch of copper for green, and\nsilver for blue. But red was a different story: for red phosphors it took additional decades' worth\nof research to find anything that worked. This is the reason why color television didn't come on\nthe scene until the mid-1960's, a full 40 years after black white television was introduced! The red\nphosphor challenge was finally solved by using a complex mixture of yttrium, oxygen, sulfur, and a\nbit of europium for good measure.\nSince we've listed yttrium, I have to mention that it is one of four - yes four! - elements that\nwere discovered in the same cave in the same town, Ytterby, Sweden. Yttrium, terbium, erbium,\nand ytterbium are all named after this town. We're still waiting for cambrium or bostonium.\nNow, it's only your parents or grandparents who will remember what watching TV on a CRT\nwas like. That's because TVs nowadays work on a different principle, namely light emitting diodes\n(LEDs). But in the end, it's still painting with electrons! An LED emits light using the cascade\nof electrons from high energy to low energy in a solid material. We'll learn all about that material\n(it's called a semiconductor) and why electrons can make light this way a little later in the semester.\nThe light that comes out of an LED in your TV (or phone or tablet) still often passes through a\nphosphor, since the phosphor can be used to fine-tune the color of light we see. In this case the\nphosphor is stimulated by light instead of electrons, but the outcome is the same: light and color\nare produced using electrons and chemistry.\nWhy this employs\nHow can we get a job based on the discovery of the electron? That's kind of like asking how we can\nget a job related to the knowledge of atoms - in other words, electrons and atoms make up everything\nso anything would qualify, at least if it has any reference to matter in the employment description.\nBut how about if we go back, specifically, to that first beam of electrons that Thompson made to\ndiscover their very existence. . . what jobs might involve beams of electrons. We already discussed\npainting with electrons in the topic of displays in Why This Matters, but it turns out there's a whole\nlot more you can do with a beam of electrons than just make pictures. To do so, though, we'll need\nmore power. A lot of power.\nIf you crank up the power of that electron beam enough, and you keep it in a vacuum (just like\nThompson did) to make sure they don't scatter off of anything, then you can use the electron beam\nto create very localized heat, enough to melt any material. If it's done to join two materials together\nin a precise manner we call it welding. Electrons have a lot of advantages in welding because they\ncan be focused to very small areas using magnetic fields, and the power can be dialed in to whatever\nthe job requires (and there's almost no limit to how powerful you can make a beam of electrons).\nOn the higher end, for industrial welding, electron beams can get up to much as 10,000,000 Watts\nper mm3 which can heat up a metal at a rate of 1,000,000,000 Kelvin per second!\n\nElectron beam welding is a big industry, and there are many jobs associated with it. You could\nweld metal parts together at GE for its aviation business, and I mention that company specifically\nbecause it was James Russel who invented electron beam welding while he was at GE, back in the\n1950's (as a fun side note, he also invented the first CD). If you do a search for electron beam welding\nyou'll find huge numbers of listing for companies that provide it as a service to other companies.\nBodycote, for example, states that they are, \"the world's leading provider of heat treatments and\nspecialist thermal processing services,\" and with 5,700 employees in 26 countries they have a lot of\njobs. But there are many smaller scale operations that hire people who like to shoot massively high\nenergy electrons at metal parts, like the family-owned Roark in Brownsburg, IN, which boasts one of\nthe largest electron beam welding chambers in the U.S., or Precision Technologies, Inc., which has a\ncool-sounding 5-axis electron beam welder that goes up to 150 kV, \"capable of welding parts as small\nas a few grams up to ones weighing several tons,\" or how about Fraunhofer FEP which develops\ncustomized electron beam technologies and states, \"Using electrons we improve your materials and\nproducts!\" Cool.\nExtra practice\n1. Your friend Wonder Woman tells you that her bracelets are made of a metal, Feminum (this\nis legit, it was in the '70s TV show), only found on her home island. Feminum (symbol Fm) has\natomic number 120 and atomic mass 285.47. The element has 2 isotopes, 285Fm and X Fm. The\nnatural abundance of 285Fm on the island is 77%.\na. What is the other isotope, and what is its natural abundance?\nb. How many protons and neutrons does each isotope have?\n2.

The atomic mass is the weighted avg. of the two isotopes. Solve the weighted\naverage equation to obtain the missing mass number:\n(0.77)(285) + (0.23)(x) = 285.47\nx = 287.04, rounds to 287\n2. The number below the atomic symbol is the atomic mass.

By assuming\nthat electrons orbited around atomic nuclei--like planets around the sun--Bohr showed that the\nelectrons bound to atomic nuclei can only exist in discrete energy levels. By equating the attractive\nforce of the Coulomb interaction between the negatively charged electron and the positive nucleus,\nFCoulomb = -Ze2/r2 , and the repulsive force due to rotation, F = mv2/r, and substituting the\nquantized angular momentum, L = mvr = nh/2, we find formulas for the quantized radius and the\nquantized energy. The energy of an electron in the nth energy level of an atom which has Z protons\nis\nE = -13.6Z2/n2 [eV ]\nThe integer n, which can have any positive value ≥ 1, is called a quantum number because it makes\nit so that the energy can only take on certain, discrete values as opposed to a continuum of possi\nbilities. The state n=1 is the ground state, and higher energy levels are called excited states.\nWhen an electron goes from a state with a lower quantum number to one with a higher quantum\nnumber, the energy of the electron becomes less negative: it gains energy. We know that energy\nmust be conserved, so the energy gained in such a transition must come from somewhere. In fact,\na photon with exactly the ΔE between two energy states in the atom can be absorbed, exciting\nthe electron. Similarly, if the transition happens in the opposite direction, the excess ΔE can be\nemitted in the form of a photon.\nThe kinds of photons capable of being absorbed or emitted by a Bohr model atom or molecule\ncan be equivalently characterized by their energy, frequency, or wavelength. Einstein taught us that\nlight can also be quantized in his work on the photoelectric effect: the energy of the photon can take\ndiscrete values:\nE = hf = hc/λ\nWhere f is frequency, λ is wavelength, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and the second\nequality is true because c=fλ. The wavelength of light that can interact with a particular energy\ntransition can be found by equating the two expressions above. With this in mind, we see that\nlight can be used to probe what electronic transitions are happening in an atom or molecule, and\ntherefore what energy levels are present in a material. The Bohr model fit the spectral lines of stars\nobserved previously by astronomers; in particular, the discrete wavelengths emitted by hydrogen gas\nthat had been observed by spectrometer finally had an explanation.\nThere are a few limitations to the Bohr model. We now know that electrons are not really or\nbiting the nucleus (although their angular momentum is quantized as predicted). Further, the Bohr\nmodel can only be used to describe electronic transitions with a single electron, such as H, He+ , or\nLi2+ . However, the key takeaways hold: if the energy states in an atom or molecule are known, the\nwavelengths of light that can be emitted or absorbed by the material are also determined. Likewise,\nif the discrete wavelengths emitted or absorbed by an atom or molecule are observed, the energy\nlevels available to an electron are also known.\n\nWhy this matters\nHow does absorption of photons by electrons that are transitioning from one energy level to another\nmatter? One application this principle is connected to is the refrigerator(!) That might not seem\nobvious at first, but let's see why. Take a look at the average energy used by a fridge in the U.S.\nover a 55-year period. It's interesting to note that the average size of a refrigerator grew steadily\nfor 35 years and then plateaued in the 1980's.\nThis, it turns out, was not because\npeople didn't want more fridge,\nbut rather because they couldn't\nfit anything larger through the\nkitchen door. More to the point,\nnote that the energy use per unit\nincreased along with the size for 30\nyears, until suddenly it started de\ncreasing rapidly in the 1970's, even\nthough the size continued to in\ncrease. This is because during that\ntime there was also an oil short\nage and people were starting to get\nconcerned about energy use. Some\nof these people had important ti\ntles like President of the United\nStates (Nixon, Ford, and Carter),\nand a whole lot of legislation aimed\nat energy conservation happened because of them. For example, President Ford signed the first law\never on this topic in 1975, the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, which led to the establishment\nof fuel economy standards for cars and efficiency standards for appliances. After that, more laws\nwere signed that created incentives to lower energy consumption (towards a goal of making the U.S.\nan energy independent nation by 1985), with Carter presenting a plan to congress stating that,\n\"conservation is the quickest, cheapest, most practical source of energy,\" requiring federal agencies\nto develop energy conservation plans, and creating the Department of Energy (DOE).\nIn this Why This Matters, I want to emphasize the importance of government policy. It was the\ngovernment stepping in that led to the technological innovation that led to greater efficiency and\nlower costs. In 1992, the Energy Star program was introduced which led to even greater reduction\nin the energy consumption of appliances and critically increased consumer awareness. Not only did\nrefrigerators themselves become cheaper because of this innovation, but the energy they used con\ntinued to decrease. In 2019 in the U.S., we save about $20 billion annually on energy consumption\nalone for our refrigerators compared to the 1970's. Sadly, since 2017, the Trump administration\nhas been trying to eliminate the Energy Star program, which many consider to be one of the most\nsuccessful voluntary energy efficiency programs in the world. It has saved Americans $430 billion\nin energy costs across hundreds of appliances, not to mention the lower CO2 emissions that have\nresulted.\nAverage energy use vs. time (c) source unknown.\nFigure above: All rights reserved.

That is the Montreal Protocol, which was signed in 1987\nand was the first treaty to be ratified by all countries in the world. It represented universal agree\nment to protect the stratospheric ozone layer by phasing out both production and consumption of\nozone-depleting chemicals, like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Taking this action led to the recovery\nof the earth's ozone layer that protects life from harmful UV radiation. Millions of lives have been\nsaved as a result. But what is it about CFC's that makes them deplete ozone? And why is ozone\nso important for blocking UV radiation? The answer, of course, comes from chemistry.\nOzone is a molecule consisting of three oxygen atoms, O3, and a common CFC molecule consists of\na carbon atom, three chlorine atoms, and a fluorine atom, CCl3F . Occasionally, the CFC molecule\nbreaks down and gives up one of its Cl atoms, like this:\nCCl3F (g) → CCl2F (g) + Cl(g)\nNote the \"(g)\" subscripts are included to show that all this is happening in the gas phase. Once a\nchlorine atom is freed up, it can then react with ozone, like this:\nO3(g) + Cl(g) → ClO(g) + O2(g)\nAnd so each CFC molecule can deplete one ozone molecule. But it doesn't stop there. A third\nreaction takes place, since there are also oxygen atoms in the stratosphere. When an oxygen atom\ninteracts with the ClO molecule, it reacts with it to make O2, like this:\nClO(g) + O(g) → Cl(g) + O2(g)\nAnd therein lies the real problem: the Cl atom is now free again and ready to attack another ozone\nmolecule. Because of this catalytic cycle, one single CFC molecule can lead to the destruction of\n100,000 ozone molecules!\nThat brings us to the second question from above:\nwhy does losing ozone lead to more UV radia\ntion?\nThis is where electron transitions come\nin.\nCheck out the plot in this figure of the so\nlar spectrum.\nThe x-axis is the wavelength of\nlight coming from the sun, covering only the UV,\nvisible and infrared (so it is just a sliver of the\nfull EM spectrum we showed a few pages back).\nThe y-axis is the intensity of light at a given\nwavelength, in Watts per area.\nA Watt is a\nmeasure of power, which is energy per time, or\nJoules/s.\nIn plain words, this is a plot show\ning the power of sunlight as a function of its\ncolor.\nSolar radiation spectrum by Robert A. Rohde as part of\nthe Global Warming Art project. License: CC BY-SA.\nSource: Wikimedia Commons.\n\nThe first thing to point out on the plot is that solid black curve, which corresponds to a theo\nretical prediction of the black body radiation emitted by an object at the temperature of the sun.\nThis temperature varies a lot depending on where in the sun it's measured, but near the surface,\nT=5250*C is a decent approximation. Note that it's a nice continuous spectrum, and it has a shape\ntypical of black body radiation (remember, that's the kind of radiation we mentioned earlier - the\nkind that Planck introduced the concept of quantization to explain).\nNext, there's the yellow shaded parts that correspond to the actual measured power from the sun be\nfore it interacts with our atmosphere. It follows the black body radiation quite well, which validates\nthe prediction. And then, there's the red shaded region. This is the power from the sun as measured\non earth, so the only difference between the red and the yellow is that the red is a measurement of\nphotons from the sun that have passed through the atmosphere. It follows the yellow pretty well\nin general, except that now there are gaps in the spectrum: discrete wavelengths where there is no\nlight observed on earth at all! The plot shows the reason why: next to some of the larger gaps, there\nis a molecule. H2O is listed in several spots. One gap is attributed to O2 and another to CO2, and\none of those gaps is due to our nice, friendly, no-longer-getting-depleted ozone molecule, O3. It's the\ngap all the way over on the left side of the plot, and it's right where the UV light would have been\nshining down on us. We can see that it does indeed shine down on us outside of the atmosphere\n(the yellow), but not at the earth's surface (the red).\nThis tiny sliver of absence of UV light due to the O3 molecule is absolutely essential for life on\nearth as we know it, and it's all thanks to electrons being pumped up in energy from one state to\nanother. In this case it happens in a molecule, not an atom, but the same principle we learned in\nthis lecture for electron transitions according to the Bohr model applies. There are discrete energy\nstates where electrons are allowed to be in the O3 molecule, and transitions between these energy\nlevels can happen when an electron either absorbs or emits a photon. Just like the Bohr model for\nthe hydrogen atom, the discrete nature of electronic transitions in molecules means that absorption\nof light occurs only at distinct points in the spectrum. For ozone, there just happens to be an\nenergy difference between two electron states that has the energy of a UV photon, which is why this\nparticular molecule absorbs well in the UV.\nWhy this employs\nI was thinking about mentioning jobs in spectral astronomy, since the Bohr model explained the\nobservation of spectral lines from hydrogen and other light elements out in space. The same type\nof analysis, using basically just a (much) fancier version of the spectroscope you got in your Goodie\nBag, is used today to understand the stuff that makes up distant stars, nebulae, galaxies, quasars,\nall sorts of other intergalactic matter, including whether exoplanets have earth-link atmospheric\ncompositions.\nBut instead of going down that outer space route, I'd like to pick up here on the point I made\nin Why This Matters, regarding how solving the ozone depletion problem is a beautiful example\nof how important science policy can be in making the world a better place. What employment\n\nopportunities are there along such lines? \"Science policy\" is a broad term that can apply to a wide\narray of jobs and activities, from deciding how science is funded to how it can (or cannot) be trans\nlated into commercial products, to how science impacts human health to protecting the health of\nthe environment. The jobs that result from this direction often involve a connection to politics and\nWashington (if in the U.S.) but they don't necessarily have to. One way to get involved is through\nfellowships, where students can engage with policy-makers in DC for a summer or a semester.\nThere are a number of options along these lines, like the AAAS Diplomacy fellow (check out\nhttps://www.aaas.org/programs/science-technology-policy-fellowships), or fellowships at the Sci\nence and Technology Policy Institute, or the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy\n(OSTP). And then beyond such general ones there are many specialized fellowships in science policy\nthat go by the sub-field, like the American Geophysical Union Congressional Science Fellowship, or\nthe various NOAA Sea Grants for ocean-related policy, or the John Bahcall Public Policy Fellowship\nfor astronomy. And many more.\nBeyond fellowships there are tons of jobs out there, like at science policy centers, think tanks\nor other organizations, from the Union of Concerned Scientists, to the RAND Corporation, to UN\nESCO, to the Federation of American Scientists, to the Center for Science in the Public Interest,\nto University-based centers like Arizona State's Consortium for science policy and outcomes. These\nare only a very few examples - there are so many more. You could get involved directly with the\nscience funding agencies like the NSF, DOE, or NIH (if you become a program manager at any of\nthose please give me a call). Science policy is an incredibly important part of what science is, what\nit can become, and how it can be used most effectively, wisely, and for the good of the world.\nExtra practice\n1. What is the energy associated with the ground state in a lithium ion?\n2. If a light wave has the same magnitude of energy as the lithium ground state, what are the\nfrequency and wavelength of this light?\n\nSolutions\n1.\nZ2\nEn = -Ry\n= -13.6\n= -122.4eV\nn2\n2.\nhc\nE = hν = λ\n(4.14x10-15[eV s])(3x108[m/s])\n122.4[eV ] =\n(λ[m])\nλ = 9.9 × 10-7[m]\n\nLecture 5: Wave-Particle Duality and Quantum Mechanics\nSummary\nThis chapter, we continued our discussion of ionization. We restricted our examples to ionization of\nhydrogen atoms in order to use Bohr's model of the atom. An electron in the ground state, or lowest\nenergy state, of a hydrogen atom has an energy of -13.6 eV. Therefore, this electron's ionization\nenergy, or the energy required to free it from the nuclear pull and effectively transition it to energy\nlevel n=inf, is 13.6 eV. The ionization energy of an electron in an atom with atomic number Z can\nbe found with the following formula:\n!\nΔEionization = -13.6Z2\n1 - 1\n[eV ]\nn\nn\nf\ni\nIonization energy can be thought of in terms of Einstein's photoelectric effect. In his ground\nbreaking experiment, Einstein shone light (streams of photons) of different energies onto slabs of\nmetal. The photons had to reach a minimum threshold energy in order to ionize the metal atoms.\nIt makes sense that metals with higher first ionization energies will be better able to hold on to their\nelectrons. In other words, light with higher frequency will be necessary to ionize metals with higher\nfirst ionization energies. Photo-Electron Spectroscopy (PES) is a characterization technique\nthat involves ionizing materials with photons and measuring the removed electrons' kinetic energies.\nThe energy of the bound state of each removed electron can be calculated by finding the difference\nbetween the incoming photon's energy and the resulting kinetic energy of the freed electron.\nThe Bohr model couldn't explain quantization of electron levels; they were imposed in the model,\nbut not understood. Through a series of experiments in the early 20th century, wave-particle\nduality was demonstrated. This meant that light waves were shown to behave as particles, and\nparticles were shown to behave as waves. The most famous of these experiments was the double-\nslit experiment, where electrons were shown to act like both waves and particles. Louis de Broglie\nshowed that all matter acts like a wave and has a corresponding wavelength (λ). This wavelength\ncan be found using the de Broglie relation, where p is the object's momentum, which is equal to its\nmass times its velocity, and h is Planck's constant:\nh\nλ = p\nErwin Schr odinger, with The Schr odinger Equation, described the relation between a wavelike\nparticle's spatial distribution and its allowed energies. In the Schr odinger equation, quantization\nis a natural consequence of solving for a standing wave. This wavefunction ψ does not have direct\nphysical meaning, at least that we know of, but its square |ψ|2 corresponds to the probability of\nfinding the particle at any given location. Solving the Schr odinger equation for an electron in an atom\ngives a set of wavefunctions that correspond to the electron's energy levels and spatial probability\ndistributions. Note the dramatic difference from the Bohr picture: now the electron can be anywhere\nthere is a nonzero |ψ|2 which is almost everywhere. The concept of exact position does not apply in\nthe quantum world, since particles cannot have their position and momentum specified exactly, in\naccordance with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.\n\nWhy this matters\nLet's apply the de Broglie wavelength equation to an electron. We know the mass of an electron\nis 9 × 10-31 kg. Now put the electron in an electric field caused by a voltage of 100 V. We know\nthis will cause the electron to accelerate and gain some momentum. Specifically, the energy of the\nelectron is: charge*voltage = e*V = 100 volts *1.6 × 10-19 Coulombs = 1.6 × 10-17 Joules. This\nis because the unit volts is equal to units of J/C. So now we have an energy of the electron ac\ncelerated across 100V, and from that we can get its velocity, v 6 × 106 m/s. Next we can get its\nwavelength: λ = h/mv = 6.6 × 10-34J∗s/(9 × 10-31kg ∗ 6 × 106m/s), which when we realize the\nunits of J = [kg][m2]/[s2] we see gives us λ = 1.2 × 10-10m = 0.12nm for this electron.\nRemember the electromagnetic spec\ntrum from last chapter? That's light\ncovering orders of magnitude of wave\nlength, only a sliver of which lies in\nthe visible range (400-750 nm). But\nin order to use this light to see things,\nwe must use a wavelength of light that\nis either equal or smaller in size to\nwhat we're trying to see. Otherwise\nthe light simply won't pick it up (you\ncan check out the physics of diffrac\ntion for more info on this, but for now, you can take my word on it). The correlation between\nthe limit of what we can see and the wavelength of light we use to see it is why I like this other\nelectromagnetic spectrum picture. On it is superimposed examples of objects the size of the given\nwavelength. If we want to use a type of light to see, say, a human, then we'd need to stay at or\nbelow wavelengths of 1 m since humans are about 1 m in size. That doesn't mean we can see in the\nmicrowave region, but that's just a limitation of our eyes not of what is possible with a type of light.\nWith better eyes than ours, we'd be able to use microwaves to see people, but we wouldn't, for exam\nple, be able to use radio waves since they have a longer wavelength than the thing we're trying to see.\nNow let's go to the atomic scale: at the x-ray part of the spectrum, we'd need to use x-rays or\ngamma rays to see objects at that scale. But it turns out that not only can our eyes not see in that\npart of the spectrum, but even the devices and detectors we've built cannot see all that well. We\ncan take x-rays and do so all the time, but only to see images on the mm resolution as opposed\nto nm. For the latter, we'd need to see an x-ray reflecting off of a nm-sized object and be able\nto measure it with precision, something we're not able to do. That said, we do use x-rays to get\natomic-scale information, but that's a different thing all together and it has to do with the spacing\nbetween atoms in solids. We'll learn all about that later in the semester. But here we're still trying\nto actually \"see\" the object and the object is an atom. We can't use x-rays--even though they're\nat the right wavelength--and forget about gamma rays, because they're even harder to detect. But\nwhat else could we use?\nThat's why we did the electron wavelength calculation to start this Why This Matters section -\nThis figure is in the public domain (created by NASA).\n\nusing the fact that an electron is a wave, and by giving it the right velocity, we can make an electron\nhave exactly the wavelength needed to see at the atomic scale. Electrons can be our \"flashlight\"! It\nalso turns out they're a lot easier to capture and use to construct images than x-rays. This discovery\njump-started the whole field of electron microscopy and changed the way we see matter. It was Don\nEigler and Erhard Schweizer who showed in 1989 that by seeing individual Xe atoms, they could\narrange 35 of them to spell their company's logo. This is definitely an expensive way to write a logo,\nbut the point is that the accomplishment realized Richard Feynman's dream of being able to put an\natom wherever you want.\nSpeaking of Feynman, he was an incredible scientist and a masterful teacher. If you want to see\nan amazing lecture entirely devoted to the double-slit experiment, find and watch Feynman's 1959\nspeech, \"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom,\" and you won't regret it. This is where he laid out\nthe dream of putting atoms anywhere you want, and that was truly the first vision of the field we\nnow call nanotechnology. The reason it took 30 years to realize Feynman's dream is that we were\nworking in the dark, literally. If you can't see atoms and molecules, it's hard to control them or at\nleast know that something you've done led to an atomic-scale control that you wanted. This type of\ncontrol led to the nanotechnology revolution and it was entirely enabled by the ability of scientists\nto see materials at the nm scale, which as you now know was made possible by the wave nature of\nthe electron.\nWhy this employs\nIt is true that we put humans on the human without resorting to quantum mechanics, evidence to\nhow powerful and useful the classical view of the world is. But in order to truly understand the\nworld, from the atom to the oceans and mountains to the universe to life itself, the quantum nature\nof it all must be understood and in some cases quantum effects completely dominate. Electrons and\ntheir interaction with light fall into this category: without a quantum description there's no hope\nin explaining the interactions that take place. So let's talk about jobs related to lasers.\nStimulated emission (first discussed in a paper by Einstein in 1917) involves the interaction be\ntween a photon and an atom that has electrons in an excited state. If the photon has just the right\nwavelength when it hits the excited atom, then the atom emits a second photon identical to the\nfirst. The LASER is \"Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation,\" and it is entirely\nand only described by quantum mechanics since it relies on knowing the discrete energies levels of\nelectrons in the atom. And by the way, any time you're online, you're using a laser since that's how\ninformation travels through fiber optic cables.\nThere are so many job postings for \"laser engineer\" that it wouldn't be possible to even begin\nto list (one site I just checked has 7000+ listing!). The reason is that lasers are used today in every\nwalk of life. There are jobs with lasers in medicine, like in eye surgery, to industry where lasers cut\nand weld, to tracking systems for all sorts of applications, to research in new types of spectroscopy,\nto so many many more. So if you want a job that uses wave-particle duality to make coherent light,\nthen that's an awesome first step, but the next step would be to get more specific.\n\nTake LIDAR as an example: this stands for Light Detection and Ranging, which is a remote sens-\ning method that uses laser pulses to measure distances. LIDAR has completely revolutionized the\nability of robots, like self-driving cars for example, to see. It's inside those bulky boxes on top of a\nself-driving car that spins continuously, giving 360 degrees of visibility as well as extremely accurate\ndepth information (to +/- 2 cm). It's still expensive ($75K a pop for the car-top systems!), but\nbecause of how enabling LIDAR is, and how much the demand for this technology will grow, there\nare many jobs opportunities. These range from jobs at big player companies like Velodyne that's\nalready selling systems to many markets, to smaller companies trying to innovate the technology\nlike Luminar that promises a $500 LIDAR system in the size of a soda can. There's a whole range\nin between including self-driving car companies themselves like Waymo that have decided to build\ntheir own LIDAR systems. And this was just one tiny example of the vast number of LASER-based\njob opportunities.\nExample Problems\n1. You observe hydrogen electrons transitioning from n=3 to n=1.\na) What is the energy change in this transition? Is it absorption or emission?\nb) What color light do you observe?\nc) How many possible transitions could an electron falling from =3 to n=1 complete? Which\ntransition is responsible for the orange color?\n2. A red laser, a green laser, and a blue laser shine on different pieces of the same kind of metal, and\ndetectors are set up to measure the presence of emitted electrons. For the red laser, no electrons\nare detected. For the green laser and the blue laser, electrons are observed flying off of the metal.\nWhich of the following statements must be true?\ni) The number of electrons emitted from the metal using the blue laser is greatest\nii) The kinetic energy of electrons emitted from the metal using the blue laser is highest\niii) The red laser would lead to electron emission if the laser intensity was increased\n\nSolutions\n1. a) The electron is falling to a lower energy state from a higher energy state, so it must be emission.\nΔE = -13.6Z2( 1 - 1 ) = -12.09eV\nWe can double check our intuition: since the energy value we found is negative, the transition must\ncorrespond to emission.\nb)\nhc\nλ =\n= 1.22 × 10-7 m = 102.6nm\n10.2[eV ]\nThis transition is in the UV.\nc) There are two possible paths: straight from n=3 to n=1 or n=3 to n=2 + n=2 to n=1.\nNext, calculate the wavelength of the three possible photon emissions. We already know that from\nn=3 to n=1, the wavelength of the emitted photon was 102.6nm.\nFrom n=2 to n=1:\nΔE = -13.6Z2( 1 - 1 ) = -10.2eV\nhc\nλ =\n= 1.22 × 10-7 m = 122nm\n10.2eV\nThis transition is also in the UV.\nFrom n=3 to n=2:\nΔE = -13.6Z2( 1 - 1 ) = -1.89eV\nhc\nλ =\n= 6.57 × 10-7 m = 657nm\n1.89eV\nThis transition corresponds to orange light.\n2. ii) is true, because the blue light has higher energy than green and red light, and the energy\nof electrons emitted is proportional to the energy of the photons hitting the metal surface\ni) and iii) are incorrect because the number of electrons is related to the number of photons =\nlight intensity, and light intensity does not affect energy of electrons emitted.\n\nLecture 6: The Atomic Orbital and Quantum Numbers\nSummary\nOne of the main limitations of the Bohr model is that it can only describe an atom with a single elec\ntron. To find the properties of multiple electrons in an atom, it is necessary to solve the Schrodinger\nequation, (K + V )ψ = Eψ, where K is kinetic energy, V is potential energy ( - 1/r for an electron\nin an atom), E is the total magnitude of energy, and ψ is the wavefunction, or orbital of the\nelectron. The solution to the Schrodinger equation for an electron in a hydrogen atom has three sep\narate components: ψ = R(r)P (θ)F (ψ). The full form of the solution form has three big implications:\n1. Electrons don't really orbit around atoms, at least in the sense that planets orbit around the\nsun. The solution to the Schrodinger equation yields a wavefunction, which when squared, gives\nan expression |ψ|2 = 1for the probability distribution of the electron's location in relation to the\nnucleus. Further, though each electron has some radius it is most likely to be found, there is also a\nchance that it is much closer to or much further from the nucleus. For example, while Bohr model\nelectrons with n=1 live at exactly 0.529 A from the nucleus, the wavefunction for a real electron\nin the hydrogen atom has occupational probability peaked at 0.529 A and smeared out on either\nside of that value. As the principle quantum number increases, the number of nodes--forbidden\nregions--increases, giving distinct bands around the atom where the electron is likely to be.\n2.\nFour quantum numbers are necessary to fully describe a particular solution. The principle\nquantum number, n is primarily responsible for the energy level of the electron. Just like in the\nBohr model, n can take any integer value from 1 to infinity. As n gets larger, the total energy gets\nth\nless negative (bigger). An electron is equivalently referred to as being in the n\nenergy level and\nthe nth shell; the remaining quantum numbers describe subshells. The angular momentum quantum\nnumber, l, is primarily responsible for the shape of the orbital. The values that l can take on depend\non which shell the electron is in: the range goes from 0 to (n-1). The magnetic quantum number,\nml, is responsible for the orientation of the orbital in space. Its values depend on both n and l, and\nthe range of ml goes from (-l) to (l). Finally, the spin quantum number, ms can have one of two\nvalues: +1/2 or -1/2, which is equivalently referred to as up or down.\n3. Electrons that solve the Schrodinger equation are distinct from Bohr electrons. While there is\nonly one electron per shell in the Bohr model, the Schrodinger equation gives degenerate solutions:\nas n increases, there are more and more orbital levels. Further, the Bohr model gives a fixed allowed\nradius for the electron to live, while the Schrodinger equation gives a distribution of probability\nthat an electron is at a given distance from the center (and some forbidden zones!). Finally, though\nthe Bohr model could only describe the behavior of one-electron atoms, the Schrodinger equation\nis much more broad: it can describe the electronic structure of an atom with any number of electrons.\nWe also discussed how the values for the l quantum number get the letter names s, p, d, and f\ncorresponding to l = 0, 1, 2, 3, respectively. If we say an electron is in the 2s orbital, then we know\nit corresponds to the quantum numbers n = 2, l = 0, ml = 0, and spin could be up or down. Other\nexamples of sets of quantum numbers and the corresponding orbitals were covered and these hydro\ngen orbitals were shown as the building blocks of chemistry. That's because to describe an atom\n\nand its properties, we fill these orbitals from lowest energy up, with the number of electrons Z in the\natom. This occupation follows a general trend that is the topic of the next lecture, but in this one we\ncovered a very important rule: the Pauli Exclusion Principle. This rule states that no two electrons\ncan have the same set of quantum numbers, meaning that two electrons and only two electrons can\noccupy any given orbital.\nWhy this matters\nQuantum weirdness is one of the most important reasons why nanotechnology has gotten so much\nattention recently. Now, there has been quite a bit of press about nanotechnology over the last two\ndecades, but one of my all-time favorite articles appeared long ago in the U.K. Telegraph: \"How\nSuper-Cows and Nanotechnology will Make Ice Cream Healthy.\" I always remember that piece be\ncause of the way they define nanotechnology: they describe a company as \"experimenting with\nnanotechnology, or the science of invisibly tiny things.\" I suppose I like this quote because of how\nridiculous it is, since first of all there are many different realms of science and engineering associated\nwith tiny things we cannot see (nanotechnology is one of them, but how about nuclear physics with\nits quarks and gluons, or solar wind with its hot plasma particles that reach our earth only to be\ndeflected by our planet's magnetic field, or dark matter?). Second of all, I like this quote because it\nshines a spotlight - albeit incorrectly - on one hold-up in nanotechnology development, which was\nnot being able to observe what was happening. This changed once we could use electrons as a way\nto illuminate matter, as discussed in last chapter's Why This Matters.\nThe main point is that nanotechnology holds great promise. Not so much for the reasons that\ngave it fame in the early 2000's (healthy ice cream being the least of it, we were supposed to have a\nspace elevator by now!), but rather because of the chemistry that's \"under the hood\" of nanotech\nnology. What does nanotech even mean, and why do we have a whole name for it? Let's answer\nthat with an example directly related to today's lecture.\nWe've been talking about orbitals of electrons\nin atoms and how the orbital is the probability\ncloud for the electron. Well what if we take that\ncloud, and we squeeze it? Or in other words,\nconfine it so that it can't take up the same vol\nume as it typically would. There's a name for\nthat: quantum confinement. And when we con\nfine quantum things, like in this case an elec\ntron in an atom, new properties emerge. Take\ncolor as an example. For a piece of bulk mate\nrial, where \"bulk\" here just means it's not nano\nsized, I might have something that's kind of op\ntically boring. It's just a piece of gray material.\nBut then I take out my nano-ice-cream-scooper and I make a little tiny chunk of the material. Sud\ndenly, without changing anything except the size, I can tune the color to pretty much anything I want!\nThe images above are excluded from our Creative Commons license. For details, see\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu/fairuse.\nImages of bulk semiconductors, ice cream\nscoop, quantum dot (c) sources unknown.\n\nThe fact that changing the size of this material allows us to tune a given property is quite in\ncredible. Imagine if I were to take one of those strips of metal from your first Goodie Bag and\nbreak it into two pieces: you wouldn't expect the color of the metal to change. But if you could\nbreak just a tiny piece of it off, like one with just 10-20 atoms in it, then that piece would change\ncolor. How weird is that? It's because of this electron cloud running out of real estate when the\namount of matter is small enough. When it's nanoscale, the confined probability cloud changes the\nenergy of the electron, which in turn changes the color of the material. We talked about electrons\nchanging their energy levels in atoms as a way to either absorb or emit a photon corresponding to\nthat energy shift. Well here we've got a new way to shift the starting and terminating levels them\nselves, simply by changing the size of the material. That's an example of why nano is such a big deal.\nThe ability to control the properties of a material is one of the foundations of our modern era.\nAs we've already learned, understanding the periodic table of the elements and all of the differences\nbetween the behavior of these elements gave scientists and engineers knowledge of the basic ingre\ndients that are used to build our world. Going nano is kind of like adding a whole other dimension\nto the periodic table: it's like each element can now do new things, take on new properties, and be\nutilized in new applications.\nWhy this employs\nQuantum computing has gotten a lot of attention recently, and for good reason. Over the past\ndecade, we have reached the point where quantum bits, or qubits, can be made and controlled ex\nperimentally. The computers we use today manipulate information in the form of individual bits,\nwhich are the famous 1's and 0's of the last 50+ years. But in a quantum computer, the quantum\nmechanical phenomena that we've been learning about in this chapter are used to manipulate infor\nmation.\nIt's qubits that hold the key since those are the keepers of quantum states, which have quantum\nnumbers just like the electron states in an atom. When two qubits interact with one another we get\nmuch more than just 1's and 0's, instead we get all possible superpositions. It's like being able to\nharness the probability cloud as a computing cloud where all possible answers are computed at once.\nQuantum computing is getting a lot bigger and a lot more exciting, with many companies pre\ndicting commercial quantum computers by 2025. The Why This Employs idea for this lecture is\nto take those quantum states we've just discussed and run with them. . . all the way to Google's\nArtificial Intelligence Lab, or to the team at IBM Q, or to D-Wave, or to the folks at Intel working\non their Qubit Chips, or to any of the 63 companies currently listed at Wikipedia under \"Companies\nworldwide engaged in the development of quantum computing.\" A list that is growing rapidly. And\nthat doesn't even include doing research on this topic in a lab here at MIT :)\nExample problems\n1. Write the quantum numbers for each electron in a neutral carbon atom.\n\nSolutions\n1. Note: the spin signs are selected arbitrarily, so it would be just as correct to flip them all. For\nn\nl\nm\nms\n1/2\n-1/2\n1/2\n-1/2\n-1\n1/2\n1/2\nthe 2p electrons, they must have the same spin due to Hund's rule.\n\nLecture 7: Filling the Periodic Table and Our First Bond (it's\nIonic)\nSummary\nThe Aufbau principle is a tool used to remember the (typical) order in which subshells are filled in\na multielectron atom. Electron interactions complicate which subshells are filled first: shielding and\norbital penetration affect which combination of electron energy and shape (quantum numbers n and\nl, respectively), is the next-most-stable state.\nThough the Aufbau principle generally gives the order that\nelectrons fill in the subshells, it doesn't tell the full story.\nPreviously, we learned that each orbital can hold two elec\ntrons:\none spin up and one spin down.\nWe also learned\nthat each value of l, written here as s, p, d, and f, can\nhave a different number of subshells based on the allowed val\nues of ml.\nThe electronic configuration of any atom can\nbe written using these guidelines:\nfor example, potassium is\n1s22s22p63s23p64s . Often, the electronic configuration is short\nened to include only the nearest fully occupied noble gas atom\nand the valence electrons:\nin this case, potassium is [Ar]\nThe Aufbau principle is often represented visually.\n4s .\nWhen an atom has only a partially filled shell, Hund's rule comes\nin to play: all of the orbitals in the partially-filled subshell must be singly occupied before any are\ndoubly occupied. For C, which has 6 electrons and electronic configuration 1s22s22p , Hund's rule\ntells us that the electrons are distributed as shown in the diagram below.\nIf the elements are arranged by increasing number of elec\ntrons (and protons), periodic trends start to emerge, and\nelectron filling explains the organization of the Periodic\nTable with blocks that correspond to the subshell being\nfilled. The s- and p-blocks are \"main group\" elements while\nthose in the d-block are \"transition elements\" and \"f-block\"\nare \"inner transition elements.\" A larger principal quantum\nnumber n corresponds to bigger orbitals and therefore big\nger atoms: from this, we can predict that atomic radius should increase down a period in the periodic\ntable. On the other hand, having more protons pulls electrons in towards the atom, so atomic radius\ngets smaller going from left to right across a row. If an atom loses an electron, its radius decreases:\nthis kind of atom is called a \"cation.\" Similarly, if an atom gains an electron, the \"anion\" is bigger.\nFinally, we learned that ionic bonds are the electrostatic attraction between two oppositely charged\nions: they're formed by the transfer of one or more electrons between the ions. The strength of an\nionic bond can be approximated by a Coulomb interaction: E = kQQ/r. If the distance between two\nionically bonded atoms is greater, the bond will generally be weaker! Just by looking at the size of\nthe ions that make up the bond, we can infer a lot of information about the corresponding ionic solid.\nOrbital filling diagram (upper right) by B.A. Averill & P. Eldridge in Chemistry. License:\nCC BY-NC-SA. Source: Open Textbook Library.\n\nWhy this matters\nWe just made our first bond in 3.091, and it's a strong one! Take a look at this table of lattice\nenergies (in kJ/mol) for a bunch of ionic solids. The range of ionic bond strength spans an order of\nmagnitude in this chart, but even the weakest solid listed (potassium iodide, KI, at 649 kJ/mol) is\nstill really strong with a melting temperature of 681*C.\nThe strongest ionic solid listed in this table\nis aluminum oxide, formed by combining 2 Al\natoms for every 3 O atoms (this balances charge\nwith Al being 3+ and O being 2- . Aluminum\noxide melts at a whopping 2,072*C, and its\nwidely used for its hardness and strength. For\nexample, Al2O3 is used as an abrasive, including\nas a much less expensive substitute for diamond,\nand in many types of sandpaper or cutting tools.\nBecause of its strength, it's used as an additive\nin many applications, including toothpaste! For\nthis Why This Matters moment, I'd like to focus on an unfilled need rather than an established solu\ntion. This is a problem where a harder material with the right properties and in the right structure\ncould change millions of lives.\nHemodialysis is a process to purify the blood of a person\nwho has kidneys that don't work correctly. A typical pa\ntient will have to go in 3 times per week, sit in a chair\nthat looks something like this for about 4 hours per ses\nsion, totaling 600 hours of their time and a cost of $80,000\nper year. In the U.S. alone there are 650,000 people who\nundergo hemodialysis, and this number has been growing\nsteadily over the past 30 years. It is expected that, as the\nincidence of cardiovascular diseases such as diabetes and\nhypertension increase, the population of individuals need\ning dialysis will grow as well. That machine on the left of\nthe chair in the picture is a hemodialysis machine. Dur\ning the process blood is removed from the body through\nan access point in a patient's vein, and passed through\nthe machine which removes toxins and excess fluids, after\nwhich the filtered blood is returned to the body through\nanother access point back into circulation. Here's Why This Matters.\nIf that machine could be shrunk down to a much smaller size and made portable, then patients\nwould be able to do this at home or while traveling or wherever they are, which would seriously\nSetup for dialysis (c) source unknown.

But current filters don't work well enough to make the device small and\nportable, so people who need hemodialysis treatment are stuck. That is, unless a new filter could\nbe invented, one that satisfies three key criteria: 1) the material must be biocompatible, 2) it must\nallow for selective filtration so it can remove some things but not others, and 3) it must provide\nefficient and fast filtration. Such a filter does not currently exist. Current filters are cellulose-based\nporous membranes with highly variable pore size, meaning that molecular selectivity is difficult to\ncontrol. The pores in current filters also overlap a lot, making tortuous paths that slow the fluid\nmotion, increasing the amount of time it takes for the blood to flow through. Current filters are\neasily clogged, they're delicate and tough to clean, so at best they're single-use only and at worst\nthey get clogged so much so quickly that even achieving a single use is difficult.\nHere we can consider the strong ionic bonds we\nlearned about in this lecture. Here's a picture of a\nnew filter made out of Al2O3. Note from the scale\nbar that the pores are seriously small, only 10s of\nnanometers in diameter. They're also aligned in the\nsame direction (so none of that tortuous flow slowing\nthings down), which means the flow through them\nwill be fast and efficient. And note that the pores are\nall roughly the same size, which gives the filter the\nability to sharply reject the targeted toxins. And of\ncourse, since it's a strong ionic solid, this filter can be\ncleaned very aggressively with pretty much whatever\ncleaning chemicals or thermal treatment you care to\nthrow at it. There's still much work to be done, like\nreducing the cost of making such filters, and they're\nstill a bit too brittle, but in general ionic solids hold\ntremendous potential as next-generation filters!\nWhy this employs\nThat example of a new type of ultra-resilient filter is only one of many where new high strength\nmaterials are needed. And it's not just the material itself but also the way it's processed. And\nbecause of how badly resilient new materials are needed, many of the larger chemical companies like\nDow, Saint-Gobain, BASF, Sinopec, LG Chem, Arkema, or Mitsubishi Chemical, to name just a\nfew of the giants (all of these have annual sales in the $10's of billions.\nAnd all of these companies have large teams working on making high strength materials. Sometimes\nit's high strength steel, sometimes it's plastic, and of course other times, ionic materials. All of these\ncompanies have job postings, but an excellent way to explore career interest is to do internships,\nand all of these companies also have internships for students. You could go directly to the com\npany web site, or you could also check out the resources we have here at MIT. There are a lot of them.\nFor example, take a look at the web page capd.mit.edu, where if you click on \"Jobs and Intern-\nImage of alumina filter by Assaud, L. et al.\nBeilstein Journal of Nanotechnology 5\n(2014): 162-72.

Rank the following atoms in terms of size, ionization energy, and electronegativity:\nGe\nRb\nSn\nI\n2.\nBelow is a PES spectrum for the outer electrons of a mystery element. Label the axes and\nthe direction of increasing ionization energy.\na) If the configuration of the inner electrons of the mystery element are the same as neon,\nidentify the element.\nb) Separately, while you were taking PES spectra for carbon in a vacuum, the seal on the\nvacuum machine broke and let in an unknown gas. You observe the following on the\ncontaminated spectrum:\ni. There are 6 peaks total (including the carbon peaks)\nii. Five peaks are the same height\niii. One peak is three times higher than the others\nWhat is the contaminating element? Explain your reasoning.\n\nSolutions\n1. As the period increases down the periodic table, electrons are more and more shielded from the\nnucleus, so atomic size increases. Additionally, as the group number increases across the periodic\ntable, there are more and more protons and therefore increased attraction from the nucleus, so\natomic size decreases.\n(smallest)\nGe\nI\nSn\nRb\n(largest)\n2. a) Phosphorous: its electronic configuration is [Ne]2s23p3\nb) The electronic configuration of carbon is 1s2 2s2 2p2 . Since there are 2 electrons in each shell,\nthese three peaks must be the same height. The additional peaks must therefore belong to 1s2 2s2\n2p6 , since one of the peaks is three times higher than the rest. The contaminating gas is Ne.\n\nLecture 8: Ions, Ionization, and Valence\nSummary\nThis lecture we continued our discussion of ionization energy. We saw that, similar to Li and Be\nin the last lecture, the ionization energy for the elements along the periods (from left to right on\nthe periodic table) in the p and d block increases due to a higher number of protons leading to an\nincreased nuclear pull. It makes sense that more energy is necessary to free them. On the other\nhand, going down the groups (from the top to bottom on the periodic table) the ionization energy\ndecreases because the increased shielding and distance from the nucleus is more significant than the\nincreased nuclear pull due to added protons.\nThe reason for increasing ionization energies for electrons closer to the nucleus is that these electrons\nare more tightly bound. For example, Li's first ionization energy is 5.4 eV, while its second ioniza\ntion energy is 122 eV. This second electron experiences less shielding than the first. This ionization\nenergy information can be viewed on a Photo-electron Spectroscopy (PES) plot. This is a plot\nshowing ionization energy versus relative intensity for a given element. PES involves shining enough\nenergy on an atom to ionize all of its electrons, measuring their kinetic energy, with the difference\nbeing equal to how much energy the electron was bound by. PES is a simple, powerful technique to\ndirectly measure electron occupation.\nAnother periodic trend discussed was electron affinity, or the change in energy that accompa\nnies an additional electron. The halogens (group 17 on the periodic table) have the highest electron\naffinity, because an additional electron would result in a full octet and complete filling of the sub-\nshell. Electron affinity increases along the periods of the periodic table up until the halogens.\nThis lecture also laid out the idea of valence electrons.\nThese are the electrons that occupy orbitals beyond the\nhighest filled noble gas core. For example, carbon and sil-\nFigure removed due to copyright\nicon both have 4 valence electrons. Carbon's highest filled\nrestrictions. Lewis Dot Diagrams of\nnoble gas core is [He], while silicon's is [Ne]. Valence elec-\nSelected Elements on Hyperphysics\ntrons are what drive chemical bonds. Valence electrons on\nwebsite.\natoms are depicted using Lewis Dot Diagrams, which\nare the chemical symbols of the elements with dots sur\nrounding them that represent the valence electrons. Lewis\nDot Structures are helpful in visualizing the octet rule,\nwhich states that atoms (ignoring the transition metals for now) are at their lowest and most stable\nenergy state with 8 electrons in their valence.\nIn this lecture we began applying Lewis Dot Structures to ionic bonds. Cations are depicted with\nplus signs on their top right corner, and anions with negative signs, as shown below.\n\nWhy this matters\nIn this lecture, we've been focusing on atoms that lose or gain electrons, also called ions. Now we'll\ndiscuss how this topic relates to renewable energy solutions.\nTake a look at this plot of the demand of elec\ntricity (in blue) vs. supply of electricity from\na wind farm (in red), recorded over a two and\na half month period in 2013 in Denmark. No\ntice that on the demand side, there's some vari\nability, but there's also a lot of regularity. The\n5-day work week draws more energy than the\nweekends, and the amount of energy needed doesn't really vary much from week to week. Now\ncontrast that with the supply of electricity from a wind turbine farm. Even if you put the tur\nbines in a known windy area, there's still a huge amount of variability. Wind energy is not that\nexpensive to produce, but the biggest challenge isn't cost, it's steadiness of supply. If you think\nabout how to build enough of this type of unreliable supply to meet the consistent demand, you'd\nneed to overbuild capacity by a factor of at least 10 (and even that wouldn't be enough on some\ndays)! That of course isn't going to be economically feasible, so the real solution, if we want to\nexpand how much energy we get from intermittent renewables like wind and solar, is to be able to\nstore the energy for when it's needed. If we have reliable storage, then the supply can be quite un\nreliable and we'd still be able to meet a steady demand, as long as on average the supply can meet it.\nOne of the easiest ways to store energy is to push something up a hill and then let it roll back\ndown. Push a ball up a hill and then hold it there, and when you want the stored potential energy\nback as kinetic energy, simply let it go. We pump water up hills, called \"pumped hydro,\" which is\ncurrently one of the only viable technologies that can scale up to the size (meaning, power) of actual\nelectricity grids. A massive amount of water is pumped up a hill when there's excess energy supply,\nand then rolled back down to turn a turbine to generate electricity when there's excess demand.\nAlthough this is a relatively cheap storage solution, there are all sorts of problems with scaling up\nany further than it is today, primarily because of the low energy we get from gravitational energy\nand therefore how much land is required. There's a great post that explains why it will be hard to\nincrease pumped hydro as an energy storage technology at dothemath, which is a cool site in general\nif you haven't seen it: https://dothemath.ucsd.edu/2011/11/pump-up-the-storage/.\nSo what else can we pump up a hill to store energy? This is where our ions come into the pic\nture! Ions are the key ingredient in batteries. Think of a battery as an electronic hill, and when the\nbattery is charged the ions are getting pumped up. Cations in particular, like Li+, get pushed up\nthe energy hill, and the lower energy state (down at the bottom of the hill) would be one in which\nit can get that electron back and become neutral again. When the circuit is closed, the cation falls\ndown the energy hill to meet up with the electron, which goes around the circuit doing work along\nthe way. In this case instead of mechanical work like the water, the electron is doing electrical work\ndirectly. This is one of the great advantages of electrochemical storage (a nice way of saying a bat\ntery), namely that we're storing directly the kind of energy we mostly need, electrical energy. Stored\nFigure of wind supply and demand shown above (c) source unknown. This content is excluded\nfrom our Creative Commons license.

Could they ever be used to store the massive amounts of\nenergy needed at \"grid scales\"? For reference, the U.S. uses 3 TW on average, or 3x1012 Watts =\n3x1012 Joules/second of energy, so you get a sense of what it means to be at the scale of the grid.\nLet's make sure we're straight on energy vs. power: a Watt is a Joule/second which is energy per\ntime, which is power. That's an important metric since we need to be able to access energy at a\ngiven pace. The total amount of energy is power multiplied by time, so for the U.S. if our average\npower draw as a nation is 3 TW, then our daily energy use is 72 TW-hours (TWh) and our yearly\nenergy use is 26,280 TWh. Just to give you a sense of how big this number is, a typical AAA battery\nstores about a single Wh of energy. That means if we wanted to store the U.S. energy needs all\nwe would need to do is build a storage facility containing 26,280,000,000,000,000 AAA batteries! In\ncase you're wondering, that's about a million times the number of AAA batteries sold in the U.S.\neach year.\nAnd therein lies the problem with batteries, namely their low energy density. But as I hope you're\nseeing in this class, such problems are often opportunities for chemistry to come in and make a\ngame-changing difference.\nThis figure shows the energy per weight\nvs.\nenergy per volume for a few differ\nent storage materials.\nNote that batter\nies are in the lower left, which isn't so\ngood.\nYou can see why gasoline is so\nunique:\nit's got a very high energy den\nsity both by weight and by volume, and on\ntop of that it's safe and easy to transport\nand extremely cheap.\nThe competition is\ntough.\nOne liter of gasoline stores 33 megajoules (MJ)\nof energy, or about 9 kWh if you prefer those\nunits. That liter costs about a dollar. Now take\none MIT Professor, who can output about 60\nW or 60 J/s on a good day. This means that\nthe professor can generate the same amount of\nenergy as in a liter of gasoline, 33 MJ, in roughly 153 hours. Given the average pay of an MIT\nprofessor of $10/hr, it would cost $1530 to get the energy from the professor. Compared to about\n$1 to get the same amount of stored energy from the gasoline. Batteries need to start looking a lot\nmore like gasoline and a lot less like an MIT Professor if they're going to be competitive grid-scale\nenergy storage technologies.\nThe good news is that there has already been tremendous progress in just the last 10-20 years.\nCheck out this plot of energy density vs. year for batteries. Notice the very slow progress for about\n\n150 years, with a doubling of energy density oc\ncurring roughly every 60 years. Then the slope\nof progress changes, and the reason is simple:\nchemistry. Specifically, the rapid improvements\nare happening because we've reached an era\nwherein we can make energy hills for ions with\nmany more types of materials than ever before.\nI've added to the plot the number of materials\ncathodes are made of: historically only about\n10 different cathode materials were used dur\ning those slow-paced first 150 years, but now we\ncan and do make cathodes out of over 80 dif\nferent materials, and the number is growing by\nthe week. This explosion of materials possibil\nity is due to a deeper understanding of ions and\nnew ability to design materials with more efficient energy landscapes for them to traverse. So yes,\nthere's a lot of work to do to make batteries competitive in grid-scale energy storage, but the time\nis absolutely ripe to get it done.\nWhy this employs\nKnowledge of ions can get you all sorts of jobs. But since I focused on the battery field in Why This\nMatters, let's focus on that same topic here. The global battery market is already enormous and its\nprojected growth is stunning. Here's a chart from a report from Deutsche Bank from 2016 showing\nthe projected near-term growth in battery production by some of the top companies that make\nbatteries. All of these companies are hiring thousands and thousands of scientists and engineers,\ntechno-economists (predicting tech trends is not easy!), packaging and mechanical design experts,\nand much more, all to work on various aspects of one thing: the ion. And there are many more jobs\nthan that. Big battery companies like those listed in the chart are investing heavily in hiring people\nto work on batteries, but so are little companies. And so are many research teams at universities,\nwho are spinning out companies based on new concepts.\nNot only are there many different battery chemistries that have been around for a while and are\nbeing greatly improved, from lithium-ion to nickel-metal-hydride to lead-acid, but there are also\nso many exciting completely new directions for batteries. All of these future battery technologies\ninvolve jobs, and while it's hard to list them all because of how much the field has grown, here are\na few cool directions companies are pursuing:\n- Silicon-based anodes (replacing the currently used graphite) which would increase energy den\nsity by a factor of 3\n- Using metal nanowires in the electrolyte to prevent breakdown, making the battery last 10 or\n100x longer\nFigure energy vs. year (c) source unknown.

(ok,\nbut in all seriousness, graphene has been shown to allow for much faster charge/discharge)\n- Making batteries out of foam metals\n- Making batteries foldable (paper-thin but that won't break) and also stretchable\n- Aluminum air batteries that have demonstrated a 1,100 mile range in an electric car\n- Powering the charging of batteries with variou means, from wi-fi signals (not inductive wireless,\nwhich is something else), to ultrasound, to amino acids, to urine.\n- Batteries made from sodium, zinc, sulfur, magnesium, and so many other materials!\n- Making batteries that can never catch fire\n\nExample problems\n1. Choose the larger atom from the following pairs:\na) Rb, Rb+\nb) Rb+ , Kr\n2. Draw the Lewis dot structures of FeCl3 and MgF2.\n\nSolutions\n1. a) Rb is larger, because it has an additional shell (Rb+ loses its 5s1 electron)\nb) Kr is larger, because it has one less proton than Rb+ , so the nucleus pulls less on the elec\ntrons\n2.\n\nLecture 9: Lewis Structures, Covalent Bonds, and Resonance\nSummary\nCovalent bonds are created via the sharing of\nelectrons rather than through electrostatic attrac\ntion between cations and\nThe shared electrons in\nlower and more stable\nanions, as in ionic bonds.\ncovalent bonds achieve a\nenergy state by interact-\nH-H H-Cl Cl-Cl bonds diagram removed\ndue to copyright restrictions.\ning with two nuclei instead of one.\nLewis Dot\nStructures represent the two electrons in a cova\nlent bond with lines,\nas shown for H2\nto the\nright.\nTo represent more complex molecules using Lewis Dot\nStructures, the following set of rules come in handy:\n1. Connect atoms, central often less electronegative\n2. Determine total number of valence electrons\n3. Place bonding pair of electrons between adjacent atoms\n4. Starting with terminal atoms, add electrons to each one to form octet\n(2 for H)\n5. If electrons are left over, place on the central atom\n6. If central atom hasn't reached octet, use lone pairs from terminal atoms\nto form multiple bonds to the central atom to achieve octet\nIt is possible to have more than one Lewis structure that doesn't valuate the octet rule. For these\ninstances, we calculate the formal charge. The sum of the formal charge must equal the overall\ncharge on the molecule or ion. To calculate formal charge, follow these steps:\n1. Nonbonding electrons are assigned to the atom on which they are located.\n2. Bonding electrons are divided equally between the bonded atoms.\n3. Then, the formal charge can be computed for each atom as follows:\n\nbonding e-0s\n-0\nformal charge = valence e -- nonbonding e s +\nIn addition to stability, formal charge tells us about the structure's electronegativity--atoms with\nnegative formal charge should be more electronegative, and those with positive formal charge less\nelectronegative.\nIt's also possible to have two different Lewis structures with the same formal charge. This indi\ncates that the actual molecule is a combination of its most stable resonance structures, as with the\nozone example in class, where we have on average 1.5 bonds on either side of the center oxygen.\nWe also discussed the concept of polarity--a measure of how unequally electrons are shared be\ntween two atoms in a bond. In nonpolar covalent bonds, the electrons are shared equally, as in H2.\n\nIn polar covalent bonds, the sharing is unequal. Electronegativity (χ), the tendency of an atom\nto attract a shared pair of electrons toward itself, can be used as a measure of polarity in a bond. In\na completely nonpolar bond, the two atoms will have identical electronegativities, meaning Δχ = 0.\nIn a strong ionic bond, there is a large difference in electronegativities. In CsF, using Pauling's scale,\nΔχ = 3.98 - .79 = 3.19.\nFinally, we named some ways that the octet rule can be broken. Some elements, like boron, can\nhave fewer than 8 electrons. Others, like sulfur, can have an expanded octet.\nWhy this matters\nSpeaking of the CO2 molecule and its formal charges and stable structure, that's the focus of this\nWhy This Matters. Let's get this done up front: after a century and a half of experiments and data\ncollection, the scientific community has established with enormous consensus that carbon dioxide\nemissions are the primary cause of climate change. Other theories such as solar cycles or volcanic\nactivity do not correlate with observed temperature changes, and there is now only one consistent\nexplanation for rising global temperatures and our changing climate: anthropogenic greenhouse\ngases, led by carbon dioxide.\nBy the way, if anyone (say, I don't know, a politician?) were to tell you something like, \"There\nis tremendous disagreement as to whether the earth is round. The debate over the earth's shape\nshould be encouraged -- in classrooms, public forums, and the halls of Congress,\" you would call\nsuch a remark either obliviousness or a lie. This is the same kind of lie told by many people about the\nfacts of climate change. A great deal of media coverage focuses on how to define such \"alternative\nfacts,\" but categorizing the remark is beside the point. Regardless of what we call it, this type of\nstatement is a threat to the very foundations of science, to reason-based argument, and therefore to\nsociety. Politicians may live in a \"post-fact\" world, but scientists do not, and cannot. There is no\n\"post-fact science.\"\nOk, back to our molecule. Why is this particular molecule so important for climate change and\nglobal warming? CO2 is called a \"greenhouse gas\" because of its ability to absorb infrared radia\ntion, which in turn warms the planet. Take a look back at the plot of intensity of solar radiation\nhitting the planet as a function of frequency, from Why This Matters in lecture 4. Yellow is what\nstrikes the upper atmosphere and red is what hits earth's surface, so the difference between the\nyellow and red curves is where some of that solar energy is being absorbed. Small molecules in the\natmosphere, like ozone, water, and carbon dioxide, are what absorb that incoming solar energy. You\ncan see where CO2 is absorbing, out towards the right in the infrared part of the spectrum, while\nozone is over on the left in the UV, and water is everywhere. It's the strength of IR absorption that\nmakes CO2 such an effective greenhouse gas.\nAbout 25% of the solar radiation that hits the earth (so 25% of the integrated red in the plot)\ngets reflected back out to the universe. But what is reflected is not what is absorbed: instead, most\nof the energy that is reflected is in the longer wavelength, infrared part of the spectrum. Since CO2\nabsorbs efficiently in that part, it acts like a blanket, keeping some of that reflected energy from\n\nescaping and redirecting it back to the atmosphere and surface. This blanket keeps us at a cozy 15*C\ninstead of -18*C, which is what the average temperature on earth would be if all of that reflected\nsolar energy were able to escape.\nAs an aside, the term \"greenhouse gas\" is a bit of a confusing name that has unfortunately stuck.\nThe effect of absorbing long wavelength radiation on the planet's temperature has nothing to do with\nthe effects of warming in a greenhouse used to grow plants, the latter relying mostly on preventing\nair convection from carrying heat away.\nHere's the connection back to our Lewis structures and formal charge. That efficient absorption\nof CO2 in the infrared I mentioned, that is directly related to how the atoms in the molecule vi\nbrate. The photon is absorbed because it gets transferred into vibrational energy, so the specific\nway atoms jiggle around is extremely important to what photons it can absorb and how efficiently\nit does so. If the CO2 molecule were to have a triple bond and a single bond, which is a valid Lewis\nstructure but with higher formal charge, then its patterns of vibrations would change dramatically\ncompared to the more stable double-bond case (with formal charge=0), which in turn would make\nit much less efficient at absorbing all the infrared energy!\nWhy this employs\nToday's lecture has been about the covalent bond, a convenient way to represent it with Lewis struc\ntures, and what we can learn about molecules from these structures. It's hard to come across a job\nin any engineering or science field that doesn't require at least some understanding of the covalent\nbond since it's so ubiquitous. This also makes it hard to zero in on a specific job market for Why\nThis Employs. That's why I'm going to focus way down to a single material - carbon - and the jobs\nyou could find related to its covalent bonds.\nIn a few lectures we'll be learning about molecular orbitals and as an example you'll see just how\nflexible carbon can be in its bonding environment. It's one of the most flexible elements in the whole\nPT in that it likes single, double, and triple bonds as well as anything in between (read: resonance\nstructures and delocalization). Let's pick one of the many forms carbon takes to focus on here: the\naromatic ring. The term aromatic does have its origins in the fact that aromatic molecules can have\na sweet fragrance to them, but in fact benzene--the classic aromatic molecule-- has no such smell.\nInstead, the way the term is used in chemistry is that the electrons in a ring of carbon have lowered\ntheir energy by delocalizing (yes, resonance structures!). Most often this occurs for a ring that\nhas alternating single and double bonds, which then form an average over its resonance structures.\nBenzene is the classic example of this, as it is the simplest aromatic ring one can make.\nAnd you've probably heard of benzene before, but what you may not know is just how many ways\nbenzene can be modified to make or do something useful. Check out this chart of only a very small\nfraction of benzene derivatives, where the ring has some addition(s) to give it a specific property or\nfunctionality. This massive variation of the chemistry of a single molecule is possible largely because\nof that covalent bond that carbon makes.\n\nFigure of benzene derivatives by Compound Interest 2014 - www.compoundchem.com.\nLicense: CC BY-NC-ND.

For\nmore information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/fairuse.\nMany materials we encounter on a daily basis are manufactured from derivatives of benzene. Polystyrene,\nfor example, is a polymer formed by connecting styrene molecules together, and billions of kilograms\nof polystyrene are produced each year. So, certainly jobs in companies that involve manufacturing,\nrecycling, or utilizing plastics like polystyrene are related (I'm thinking a senior chemist position at\nBASF, a chemical manufacturing company, for exam\nple). But the uses of benzene derivatives go far beyond\nplastics. For example, industries use benzene to make\nresins, nylon and many different synthetic fibers, as well\nas lubricants, rubbers, dyes, detergents, drugs, and pes-\n3-D image of acetaminophen molecule\nticides. Take medicine as another example: here's the\nremoved due to copyright restrictions.\nacetaminophen (Tylenol) molecule - it's a benzene deriva\ntive!\nSo the pharmaceuticals industry is also a great place to\ntake your knowledge of benzene (I'm thinking Johnson\nand Johnson, Pfizer, Novartis, and so on). These compa\nnies invest billions and billions of dollars every year to fund\nresearch on the development and testing of new medicines,\nmany of which have at their core a resonant Lewis structure.\n\nExample Problems\n1.

This model\nallows us to predict the shapes of molecules--a precursor to more fully understanding their proper\nties. VSEPR is based around electron repulsion, and gives the most stable structures as those that\nminimize these repulsions. To find the VSEPR representation of a molecule, follow these steps:\n1. Write Lewis structure\n2. Classify each electron pair as bonding or nonbonding\n3. Maximize separation between domains\n4. Give more space to non-bonding domains and to bonding domains with higher bond order\nA bonding pair (BP) of electrons is any two electrons that take part in a bond. A double bond is\nmade up of 2 BPs, and a triple bond is made up of 3 BPs. A lone pair (LP) of electrons is any two\nelectrons that are not part of a bond. The strength of repulsion between electron pairs, in ascending\norder, goes as follows: BP-BP, BP-LP, LP-LP. Also, the repulsion of a single BP is less than that\nof 2 BPs or 3 BPs.\nVSEPR Geometries by Boundless Chemistry. License: CC BY-SA. This content is excluded\nfrom our Creative Commons license.

(Before we get\nexcited about how awesome that is, consider that a dog can smell between 10 and 100 thou\nsand times better than a human!). But what is smell, from a chemistry perspective? Taste and\nsmell are related, and thinking about what's behind them\ngoes back to the ancient Greeks. None other than our\nfriend Democritus (atomism!) speculated that the taste\nDiagrams of tongue, taste\nof a substance was due to the shape of its component\npapilla and taste bud removed\nparticles.\nHe thought that acidic particles would be\ndue to copyright restrictions.\nsharp, since they felt like they attacked your mouth,\nwhile sweet stuff was made of nice cuddly soft shapes.\nWhile his reasoning was quite simple, the idea that taste\nand smell were governed by shape was amazingly pre\nscient.\nFast forward 2500 years and we now know that the ability to taste and smell works through\n\"receptor sites\" in the tongue and nose.\nHere's the\ntongue broken down, showing the receptor site on the\nright, and below that is a larger view of receptor\nsite with various parts labeled.\nNote that the re\nceptor site is also what we call a taste bud.\nSig\nnals that get sent from this receptor site to the brain\nLabeled diagram of a taste\nthrough the nerve fibers determine what you taste,\nbud removed due to\nand the signal is deeply dependent not just on the\ncopyright restrictions.\ncomposition of the molecule itself, but also on its\nshape.\nTake a look at the two molecules below, glucose which\ntastes sweet, and quinine which tastes bitter.\nTheir\nchemistries are different and the way the chemistry of the\nmolecule bonds to the sensory cell is crucial, but the way\nthe shape fits into the pore itself and impacts the orientation of the molecule on the sensory cell\ncan be equally important. If we didn't know the shapes of these\nmolecules, we'd write them out as simple 2D Lewis structures, but\nit's those 3D shapes that you see in the figure that distinguish their\ntastes!\nIn the case of the carvone molecule, or C10H14O, we have an even\nmore striking example of the role of shape on smell. This molecule\nforms two mirror images, denoted R and S in the figure below. The\nR form smells like spearmint while the S form smells like caraway\nseeds. Same exact chemistry, different shape, different smell. Many\nmolecules can take on two forms like this with mirror symmetry but\nthat aren't the same, and such pairs are called enantiomers.

If you hold them up facing\none another you'll see they have mirror symmetry, and if\nyou try to rotate one around the other you'll see you can't\nsuperimpose them.\nFor this reason, the property of hav-\nSpearmint and caraway seed\ning mirror symmetry but not being superimposable is called\nmolecules removed due to\nhandedness, or chirality.\nThe fact that the two enantiomers\ncopyright restrictions.\nare perceived as smelling different shows that those recep\ntor cells must contain chiral groups, allowing them to re\nspond more strongly to one enantiomer than to the other.\nThus,\nboth for the molecule being smelled and for the\nmolecules used to do the smelling, molecular shape holds the\nkey!\nWhy this employs\nIt's about time we talk about enzymes. These are molecules, often proteins, folded into a specific\n(and complicated!) shape, that speed up chemical reactions in your body. Enzymes are absolutely\nessential for so many crucial functions of our body, including respiration, digestion, muscle and\nnerve function, and many more. In digestion, the role of an enzyme molecule can speed up a needed\nreaction by a factor of a million times! That lets you digest your dinner in hours rather than, well,\na thousand years.\nEnzymes work by binding to molecules in a spe\ncific way, and you may have already guessed\nthat shape is crucial. In fact, way back in 1894 it\nwas the Nobel Laureate Emil Fischer who came\n\"Lock and Key\" model synthesis diagram\nup with the \"lock and key\" model to explain\nremoved due to copyright restrictions.\nhow enzymes work. The idea in this model is\npretty much how it sounds: an enzyme's active\nsite is a specific shape, and only the substrate\nwill fit into it, like a lock and key. Here's a\ncartoon to illustrate how the enzyme perfectly\nfits, because of its shape, into a substrate, giv\ning the substrate the power to make reactions\nhappen faster (also called catalysis). The model\nhas been updated over the past 100 years, for\nexample to include the fact that the substrate\nand enzyme itself are dynamic and can change\nshape when they interact, or that the effects of\nthe surrounding solvent are important, but the key feature that shape is crucial remains the foun\ndational principle upon which enzymes operate.\n\nAs you may have noticed by just going to the grocery store, there's a big market for new foods with\nnew enzymes. There are so many enzymes involved in digestion, like lipases that help digest fats in\nthe gut. amylase helps change starches into sugars. Maltase breaks the sugar maltose into glucose\n(it's in potatoes, pasta, and beer, for example). Trypsin breaks proteins down into amino acids. Lac\ntase breaks down lactose, the sugar in milk, into glucose and galactose, and on and on. Which brings\nme to the job market: here, specifically the food industry. The synthesis and use of new enzymes\nin the preparation of food have seen tremendous growth not only in digestion but also in the taste\nand texture of the food, as well as possible economic benefits. There are many jobs related to food\nscience (check out this article in the NatureJobs pages, which is a cool site in case you haven't seen\nit: https : //www.nature.com/naturejobs/science/articles/10.1038/nj7422 - 149a?W T.ecid =\nNAT UREjobs - 20121106). But jobs related to enzymes having to do with food also relate to\nthe future of humanity itself. How will we feed our population in the future? Will all protein need\nto be plant-based? Or will we eat insect-meat? Or meat grown in a lab? Will food be 3D-printed,\nand will it be served by robots? All of these topics have recently received vast amounts of attention,\nresearch funding, led to start-ups, and a lot of interest from larger companies, and all of that spells\njobs. Specifically, jobs involving knowledge about enzymes, which in the end only function because\nof their shape (VSEPR!).\nExample Problems\n1.

Two or more atomic orbitals are added together to make a linear combi\nnation of atomic orbitals--the LCAO method--allowing for quick characterization of the kinds of\nbonds formed between two atoms.\nWhen atomic orbitals are added,\nthey can ei\nther constructively interfere,\nforming a bond,\nor\nthey can destructively interfere,\nforming an anti-\nbonding state.\nIn a molecule, the bonding state\nis always lower in energy than the correspond\ning atomic orbital, while the antibonding state is\nalways higher.\nMolecular orbital diagrams,\nor\nMO diagrams, are a convenient visualization tool\nto see how electrons are distributed between two\natoms: hydrogen is shown to the right as an exam\nple.\nThe two hydrogen 1s orbitals combine to form a σ1s bond,\nwhich is lower in energy and therefore more stable. If we\nhad started with helium instead, there would have been four electrons to distribute: two would form\na σ1s bond, but the other two would go in the σ1s ∗ antibonding state, effectively cancelling out the\nbond.\nAfter placing electrons in the MO diagram, bond order can be calculated:\nBO = ( of e' in bonding orbitals - e' in anti-bonding orbitals)\nStronger bonds have higher bond orders, and the bond order must be >0 for a bond to exist at all.\nFor our example above, a hydrogen dimer has BO=1, but a helium dimer has BO=0. This explains\nwhy hydrogen gas exists as H2, but helium gas con\nsists of individual atoms!\nIf an atom has p-orbitals as well as s-orbitals, ad\nditional bonds called bonds can form. The three\np-orbital domains yield three kinds of bonds, one σ\nand two : σnpz , πnpx, and πnpy, where n refers to\nthe particular energy level being considered. Note\nthat the σ bond forms for both s orbital overlap as\nwell as one of the p orbital overlaps: the term σ\nbond means that the bond has cylindrical symmetry\naround the bond axis, something that is not the case\nFigures above by B.A. Averill and P. Eldridge in General Chemistry. License: CC BY-NC-SA.\nSource: Open Textbook Library.\n\nfor the bonds. Anti-bonding σ∗ and π∗ states also\nform from p-orbital MOs. A generic MO diagram for p-orbitals is shown to the left.\nMOs can also be formed from heterogenous dimers: the same rules apply. Since each of the atoms\nhas distinct energy levels associated with its s- and p-orbitals, the MO diagram formed using two\ndifferent atoms is usually skewed, and the bonds that result are polar covalent bonds. The atom that\nis more electronegative is lower in energy. It can be helpful to count the number of electrons in the\ninitial atomic orbitals and make sure that they are all used when filling up the MOs. Remember that\nif a dimer is positively charged, it has lost an electron, and if it is negatively charged, it has gained\nan electron: these have to be accounted for as well! If one of the atoms has more electrons than the\nother, like a bond between H and Cl, the excess electrons form nonbonding pairs--just like the lone\npairs in the Lewis diagrams we drew before. If all of the electrons in the MO diagram are paired,\nthen the dimer is diamagnetic, but if there are any electrons left unpaired, it is paramagnetic. For\nlow molecular weight dimers, the 2s and 2p atomic orbitals are very close in energy, and they can\ninteract with each other. For dimers with lower MW than O2, the π2px,y and σ2pz orbitals switch,\nand the π2px,y states are filled up first.\nWhy this matters\nThere are two ways to separate pasta from the boiling water once it's cooked. One way is to pour\nthe mixture through a colander, or a filter, to retain pasta on one side while letting the boiling water\npass through. Another is to leave it on the stove and let all of the water boil off. Each of these\nseparation techniques leads to the same outcome, but as you can imagine they are very different. I'm\nnot talking about how the pasta would taste (let's ig\nnore that part), but rather how much energy it takes\nto carry out this separation task. Pouring through a fil\nter is easy, fast, and efficient, while leaving the pot on\nthe stove would take longer and require a lot more en\nergy.\nNow shrink down from pasta to nano-pasta. In other\nwords, the size scale of molecules. We separate molecules\nfrom one another all the time for a wide variety of in\ndustrial processes. In fact, if we look at the U.S. energy\nconsumption, about 1/3 of it goes into what is vaguely\nlabeled \"Industry.\" But did you know that 40 percent of\nthis energy for industry serves just one process, separat\ning molecules? The reason that number is so large is that we only use the slow and inefficient\nthermal approach, not the much more efficient filter approach, to perform the separations. That's\na whopping 12 percent of all energy used in the U.S. that goes into boiling one chemical off of another.\nSo why is it that we don't just pour these chemicals through a nano-filter, just like we do with\npasta and colanders? If we did switch from thermal separation to a filter, we could save up to 90\nFigure above (c) source unknown. All rights reserved. This content is excluded from our Creative\nCommons license. For information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/fairuse.\n\npercent of that energy! The reason we don't, is the filter itself. Current filters aren't yet up to\nstandard. On the one hand, we've got filters made from polymers (materials we'll learn about later\nin the semester) that can separate the tiniest of molecules very well, but they're so delicate that\nthey can't be used in the harsh chemical and thermal environments of most industrial processes. On\nthe other hand, we've got filters made from ceramics (materials with strong ionic and/or covalent\nbonds) that are super resilient and can handle the conditions, but they can't get down to the sizes\nof the small molecules that need to be separated.\nSo it is that we come to our molecular orbitals, orbital filling, and the specific example of N2\nvs. O2 covered in class. Because one of the big separations that we need to do on a massive scale\ninvolves exactly these two molecules. O2 is plentiful in the air (unless you go into a closed room,\nlight a candle, and wait 12 hours as we learned in lecture 2!), but for many applications we need O2\nin much higher concentrations than its naturally occurring 21 percent in air. Take combustion as\nan example: the 78 percent N2 in the air has a negative impact on combustion processes since the\nnitrogen molecules get heated up during the reaction to very high temperatures, which is not only\ninefficient, but breaks down into toxic nitrogen oxide (NOx) gasses. Increasing the amount of oxygen\nand decreasing the amount of nitrogen leads to much higher combustion efficiencies, lower harmful\nemissions, and higher processing temperatures. Now, you may be thinking that I'm only talking\nabout fossil fuel processing, and yes that is certainly a prime example of our use of combustion as a\nsociety, but getting purified O2 molecules reaches far beyond, to applications in the medical industry\nto sewage treatment to metal manufacturing, to name only a few.\nThe separation of O2 from N2 is in so much demand globally that it is performed at a quantity\nof 31 billion kilograms per year. Because the separation is done inefficiently using thermal pro\ncesses, in this case going cryogenic, which is cooling instead of boiling but for the same purpose,\n47 teraBtu (British thermal units, or the amount of thermal energy needed to raise one pound of\nwater by one degree Fahrenheit) of energy are used per year just to do the separation! Just to\nbe clear, that's 47,000,000,000,000 Btu of energy, or if you prefer 13,774,340,298,094 Watt-hours.\nA typical household in the U.S. uses about 900,000 Watt-hours of energy per moth, just for reference.\nHow do we save up to 90 percent of the massive energy used to separate O2 from N2 by switch\ning from thermal-based separation to a filter-based approach? The answer lies in those molecular\norbitals! They tell us about the bonding of each molecule and the interactions of the molecules\nwith yet-to-be-invented filter materials that could combine the best of both worlds from polymer to\nceramic materials. The MOs of N2 and O2 also tell us that these molecules respond differently to\nexternally applied magnetic fields, which may in turn be useful in boosting the separation efficiency.\nThere is a tremendous opportunity for new filters that take these two most abundant molecules in\nthe air and put them into separate compartments, but it all has to start with knowing how the\nelectrons in the molecules behave. And that, of course, we get from molecular orbital theory.\nWhy this employs\nThe problem with fusion energy is that it's uncontrolled. Way back in the 1950's, Disney was making\nfeel-good movies (grab some popcorn and check out, \"Our Friend the Atom\"), about how energy\n\nwas very soon going to be, \"too cheap to meter.\" 70 years later, why is this not the case? Fusion is\nso attractive on so many levels: unlike fission, which is the stuff of current nuclear reactors, fusion\nhas no radioactive waste or byproducts, with the only outcome of a fusion reaction being ridiculous\namounts of energy and helium. Fusion is the engine of the stars, so you know this energy is serious.\nLet's break it down: remember the battery vs. gasoline comparison I made in Lecture 8? Roughly,\nthe best Li-ion batteries today can store about 1 MJ of energy per kg. Gasoline, on the other hand,\ncan store 45 MJ per kg. But let's keep going. The explosive TNT stores around 4160 MJ/kg.\nUranium when used in nuclear fission stores a whopping 3,456,000 MJ/kg! This incredible energy\ndensity is a strong argument for nuclear energy generation and is often invoked. But when we move\nto fusion, when we move to the stuff of the stars, all of these numbers feel tiny. The energy density\nof the fuel for fusion, which is a combination of tritium and deuterium, is an incredible 576,000,000\nMJ/kg. And that fuel is highly abundant and cheap. That's why the dream of fusion is still alive\neven after 70 years of trying, and in fact today there is a huge resurgence in fusion energy. For more\ninformation you don't need to go very far, check out the PSFC (Plasma Science and Fusion Center)\nright here at MIT. Or the new MIT spin-out called Commonwealth Fusion Systems.\nIf nuclear fusion is to become a reality (in just 10 years according to some, but we've also been\nhearing that since the Disney movie so we need to approach with careful optimism), one of the\nsingle most important ingredients to making it work will be magnets. Lots and lots of magnets and\nvery powerful ones. That's because one of the most likely ways to get fusion to work is to contain\nthe massive energy released (which, by the way, gets to temperatures up to 100 million degrees), is\nto confine the energy using magnetic fields. Now, in fusion reactor designs the magnetic fields are\noften generated with superconducting coils, so it's different from our unpaired electrons in the MO\ndiagram of O2. But the general idea that a material can be responsive to an external magnetic field\ncomes from its electron filling, and the more electrons that are unpaired like in the O2 molecule, the\nmore responsive it can be.\nSo what are the jobs related to developing new magnets? You could go to work at a nuclear\nfusion start-up like Commonwealth Fusion, or to the large government-led fusion operations like the\nITER program in France. But so many other industries need stronger, cheaper, lighter magnets that\nthe job market extends far beyond just fusion. You could look for jobs in companies that manufac\nture magnets (there are many), or companies pursuing new ideas for recycling magnets (like Urban\nMining Company), or as a scientist at a U.S. lab pushing the frontiers of magnets (like Florida's\nNational High Magnetic Field Laboratory, or the one at Los Alamos), or at companies trying to\nmake magnets that don't rely on rare-earth elements (like Toyota for example, among many).\n\nExtra practice\n1.

Consider methane, CH4, as an example:\nthe carbon atom has two 2s electrons and two 2p electrons. The 2s and 2p states hybridize, yielding\nfour equal-energy, unpaired electrons that are ready to bond with hydrogen atoms. As hybridization\noccurs, carbon's four electrons are redistributed so as to be maximally spaced apart, lowering the\nenergy of the system and yielding the most stable state: a tetrahedral methane molecule. This kind\nof hybridization is called sp3 , because one s-orbital energy level combined with three p-orbital energy\nlevels.\nFor the case of ethane, C2H4, the hybridization process is slightly different, as shown here (this\ntime as an energy level diagram). Each car\nbon forms only three bonds: two with hydro\ngen atoms, and one with the other carbon.\nThe s-orbital energy level combines with two\np-orbital energy levels to form three equal sp\nbonds; the remaining 2p electrons form a higher-\nenergy π bond between the two carbon atoms\nand yield a double bond between the carbon\natoms.\nThe next logical molecule to consider is acetylene, C2H2. In this case, each carbon is only bonded to\none hydrogen, so only one 2p energy level hybridizes with the 2s\nenergy level to form a sp hybridized bond. The remaining 2p or\nbitals form two bonds, yielding a triple bond between the carbon\natoms.\nIn summary, hybridization occurs to lower the overall energy of the\nsystem: atomic orbitals combine with each other to form mixed\nstates with a lower average energy. Knowing the hybridization of\nthe molecule is equivalent to knowing the molecular shape: VSEPR\ngives the geometric name corresponding to the specific combination\nof bond angles that minimize the overall energy of the system.\nFigures above by B.A. Averill and P. Eldridge in General Chemistry.

In places where water\nscarcity is a serious issue, by some estimates 70% of all disease and 30% of all death can be attributed\nto the lack of water or water quality.\nFresh water\nmakes up just 2.5% of all water on earth, but more\nthan 2/3 of that is tied up in glaciers.\nThis means\nthat only 1% of all water on the planet is drinkable,\nand the balance of this precious resource is way off-\nscale.\nGiven the level of global crisis that access to freshwater\nhas become, it makes a lot of sense to turn our attention\nto the other 97% of water on the planet, saltwater in the\noceans. The problem, of course, being that it's not drink\nable (or useful in most agriculture), unless the salt is removed. The good news is that desalination\nis growing in terms of use and installed capacity, but the bad news is that it still costs far too much\nto become a ubiquitous substitute for groundwater.\nHow can we work on lowering the cost and increasing efficiency in desalination? First of all, we\nneed to know what the current cost breakdown is, and as you can see in the pie chart in this image,\nthe major cost of desalination is in the energy it takes to pump water through the system. By \"sys\ntem\" I mean a pretreatment facility where seawater is run through sand to filter out large impurities\n(shells, rocks, seaweed, etc.), followed by the actual \"de\nsal\" part of desalination, where the water is run through\na set of membranes (40,000 of them in the plant shown\nin the picture) that remove the salt and allow freshwater\nto pass. Pumping the saltwater through these membranes\nrequires by far the biggest part of the plant's energy con\nsumption, so improving the membranes and making them\nmore energy efficient is crucial. In fact, it's not just that\nthe membranes used today are energy inefficient, but it's\nalso that they get fouled up (bacteria and other organic\nmatter grow on their pores) and are extremely delicate\nso can't be cleaned very well. This means for most of\nthe time the plant is paying higher energy costs than it\nneeds to (by a factor of 2 or 3 sometimes!) because it has\nto pump water through membranes that are filthy and\nblocked and can't be cleaned. Now that's what I call a materials design opportunity! Make a better\nmembrane for the salt removal step of desalination, and make the process cheaper. That's how we\ncome to our Why This Matters and connection to today's lecture.\nWe learned about the sigma and pi bonds that can form when the AOs of carbon atoms hybridize.\nFigures above by B.A. Averill and P. Eldridge in General Chemistry. License: CC BY-NC-SA.\nSource: Open Textbook Library.\n\nIn the examples in class we had carbon bonded to hydrogen and sometimes also to itself. If we only\nhave sp2 hybridization and we only have C atoms and no H atoms, then we arrive at a very, very cool\nmaterial: graphene. It's bonded together in a honeycomb\nlattice sheet (a 2D sheet) with sp bonds, and those ex\ntra p electrons form pi bonds across the plane to give it\na huge stability boost. It's a very cool material and its\nisolation from graphite (which is just stacks of graphene)\nwon the Nobel Prize in 2010. (The scientists who discov\nered graphene were able to separate it from a chunk of\ngraphite using only run-of-the-mill tape! So remember,\nsometimes all you need for a Nobel Prize is pencil lead,\ntape, and determination). I can't possibly go into all the\ndetails for why graphene is cool, but if you search online you'll see right away. Another consequence\nof graphene is that it launched a whole field of \"2D materials\" where researchers have realized that\nso many other materials can be made into these sheets that are only one or a few atoms thick.\nIt's now even possible to make completely new stacks of 3D materials by mixing and matching 2D\nsheets (check out for example the paper by Geim and Grigorieva, \"Van der Waals heterostructures,\"\nNature volume 499, pages 419-425 (25 July 2013). By the way, Geim was one of the two scientists\nwho won the Nobel prize for graphene's discovery. The other is Novoselov, but Geim is a bit special\nas he is the only person to ever have won both the Nobel and the IgNobel prizes, the latter for\nlevitating frogs. But I digress.\nThe point is that graphene may just be the ultimate membrane. It's only 1 atom thick, so in\nterms of viscous loss it's hard to beat. Plus, it's much more resilient than today's polymer mem\nbranes so it can be cleaned easily. It's no wonder graphene's been considered as a potential for\ndesalination since 2012, even by people you might already know, for example, \"Water Desalination\nacross Nanoporous Graphene,\" by Cohen-Tanugi and Grossman, Nanoletters volume 12, pages 3602\n3608 (2012). Because of its massive potential in water desalination and also water treatement and\npurification in general, there are many research groups and even already a number of companies\nworking towards commercializing graphene-based membranes (Via Separations, for example). This\nis all extremely exciting, but it's also only possible because of the hybridization that occurs in carbon\natoms, which combined with those pi bonds allows them to take the form of graphene.\nWhy this employs\nThis is a tough one since hybridization in chemistry is what enables so many molecules to exist at all,\nand this impacts nearly all job sectors, not to mention life itself. But since we covered graphene in\nWhy This Matters let's stick to graphene here in the Employment category too. There are companies\ndirectly manufacturing graphene and investing a lot of $$ into making it cheap, at large scales, and at\nhigh quality (meaning very few defects if possible), or with tailored functional chemistries. There are\nalso different versions of graphene, from pure graphene to graphene-oxide to reduced graphene oxide\nand so on. Graphene Supermarket, ACS Material, or Graphenea are all examples of companies mak\ning graphene products and all of them have job openings for students who know about hybridization.\nDiagrams above (c) sources unknown.

For information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/fairuse.\n\nBut graphene production has been embraced in a big way by large companies, too. Toshiba has\ninvested over $50M in manufacturing plants for new carbon materials, from graphene to other sp\ncarbon nanostructures like carbon nanotubes and fullerenes. Other large chemical producers have\njoined the club, like Cemtrex, Mitsubishi Chemical, Cabot, or Aixtron, to name only a few exam\nples. And these are all just companies thinking about making graphene, but then if we expand to\nones that are using it to improve their technology, the list goes on and on. This is especially true in\nbattery companies, both big and small, where the use of sp2 carbon nanostructures like graphene has\ntremendous potential. Applications involving catalysis and electronics are also fantastic candidates\nfor the use of graphene.\nExtra practice\n1. Look at a single carbon in the portion of a diamond lattice below.

Also, we infer that the p-orbitals forming the pi-bonds\ncan either add or subtract giving delocalized electron molecular orbitals - pointing to resonance\n\nLecture 13: Intermolecular interactions\nSummary\nThis lecture focused on intermolecular forces (IMFs), which are interactions between molecules\nweaker than ionic or covalent bonds, but that on a larger scale take on an enormous role in giving\nmaterials their properties. First, we defined a dipole: a pair of charges, one positive and one\nnegative, separated by a distance. We have already seen dipoles in this\nclass--a covalent bond that involves a difference in electronegativities,\nfor example if one atom is electropositive and the other electronegative,\nHCI dipole diagram\nforms a dipole. The H-Cl molecule is a simple example shown here, where\nremoved due to\nthe arrow in the diagram points towards the more electronegative chlo\ncopyright restrictions.\nrine, and the δ+ / δ- indicate an excess of positive/negative charge. The\narrow is the direction of the dipole. It is possible for a molecule with\npolar covalent bonds to have no net dipole, as shown for CO2 below.\nThis is because its two dipoles cancel. Water has a net dipole only in the y-direction.\nThe presence of a net dipole means that the dipoles of the molecule will feel attraction to opposite\ncharges. This other charge could be an ion, or another\ndipole. The former is called an ion-dipole interaction,\nand the latter a dipole-dipole interaction. These are\nattractions between molecules rather than bonds within\nthem.\nIt is still possible for molecules with no net dipole to\nparticipate in intermolecular bonding, because even non-\npolar molecules can experience temporary dipoles due to\nfluctuations in the electron cloud. These temporary dipoles can happen due to interactions with\nsurrounding charges, in which case they are called in\nduced dipoles. These can interact with ions or perma\nnent dipoles or other induced dipoles. These fluctuations\nin the electron cloud can also be a result of tempera\nture. When these temporary dipoles interact with each\nother, the attractive forces are called London disper\nsion forces (LDF). It is easier to temporarily deform\nthe electron clouds of some molecules compared to others.\nThey have differences in polarizability. For example,\nlarger atoms are more polarizable than smaller atoms due\nto their outer electrons being less affected by nuclear pull.\nThe more polarizable a molecule is, the stronger its LDF.\nThe LDF also depends on the surface area of the molecule,\nsince greater surface area means more electron cloud that\ncan be temporarily induced to shift, which in turn means higher LDF.

The gecko is a\nperfect example of this. It's a remarkable animal that can walk up and down walls and even across\nthe ceiling without breaking a sweat! The rea\nson is that its toes are padded with microscopic\nhairs (called \"setae\"), and each of these in turn\nhas hundreds of nanoscale branches. One gecko\ntoe can have as many as a billion little hairs!\nThese hairs hold the key to its seemingly mag-\nFigure of gecko structures from\nremoved due to copyright restrictions.\nical adhesive abilities and the reason there are\nso many of them is precisely because of what\nwe learned in this lecture: weak interactions\nlike van der Waals get stronger with more sur\nface area. A billion little nano-strands on each\ntoe gives the gecko's foot a whole lot of surface\narea, especially when those strands lie nearly\nflat against whatever surface the gecko is climb\ning or sticking to. When the strand runs paral\nlel to a surface, it maximizes the amount of the\nstrand that can engage in van der Waals attraction with that surface. When the strand is more\nperpendicular, the force is dramatically reduced.\nHerein lies the secret of the Gecko, because it's not enough for it to have a super-adhesive toe,\nbut it also needs to be able to alternate between\nsuper-adhesive and not adhesive at all.\nOtherwise,\nit would stick to the wall and not be able to move!\nSo, the Gecko clearly knows all about the depen-\nPhoto of man climbing glass wall\ndence of van der Waals attraction on surface area con-\nwearing gecko gloves removed\ntact, and each time it takes a step it adjusts toe\ndue to copyright restrictions.\nadhesion by changing the angle of its billions of toe\nhairs.\nThis matters not only because it's such a cool illustra\ntion of how amazing nature can be, but also because of\nhow relevant improved reversible adhesives would be for\na broad range of applications. Yes, this includes scaling\nbuildings like Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible 4, but it also would impact areas ranging from\nadvanced manufacturing to treating wounds. Just think about what it could mean to have a tape\nthat's 1000 times stronger than current tape, and can be applied and removed thousands of times\n\nwithout loss of stickiness. Researchers and companies alike have been trying to mimic the Gecko's\nadhesive abilities for decades, and still we're not at a place where we can quite do it, although\nimproved control over the chemistry and nanostructure of materials is getting us closer than ever.\nIt all comes down to engineering the van der Waals attraction.\nWhy this employs\nThe last weak interaction we discussed in this chapter was that of the hydrogen bond. This bond is\nincredible in so many ways, not the least of which being the employment opportunities it provides.\nHydrogen bonding is prevalent (and often dominant) in determining the way in which proteins fold\nand unfold, and in the way in which the helices of DNA hold together. It is the reason paper is\npossible, and the reason fish don't freeze in the winter in a pond, to name only a few examples. But\nthe example I want to focus on for this Why This Employs is that of surface coatings. The way\na surface interacts with water can be engineered by modifying either the way in which the water\nhydrogen-bonds to the surface, the way in which water hydrogen-bonds to itself, or both.\nCoatings that repel water are needed all over the place, from keeping car windshields clear, to\nmaking clothes that stay dry in a rainstorm, to preventing condensation in power station turbines.\nThe chemistry that goes into these coatings holds the key to controlling the hydrogen bonding, and\nthere are a lot of companies interested in hiring people to work with such chemistry. This ranges\nfrom medium-sized materials companies like NEI Corporation, which makes a \"superhydrophobic\"\ncoating called Nanomyte, or UltraTech, which makes spill-containment coatings, or Aculon, which\nstates on their website, \"Where there is a surface that has a problem, we like to think we can help\nsolve that problem,\" to larger companies like DuPont that makes specialized coatings for the Oil\nand Gas industry, to small start-ups like DropWise, founded by our very own Course 2 Professor\nKripa Varanasi. These are only a handful of examples of the many companies building products\naround controlling hydrogen bonds.\nExtra practice\n1.

In a\nclosed system, an equilibrium develops as molecules convert from one phase to another (like liquid\nto gas), and vice versa (gas back to liquid). The pressure that one phase exerts on another depends\nstrongly on what intermolecular forces are present in the system. Strong IMFs lead to low vapor\npressures, while weak IMFs lead to high vapor pressures.\nThe vapor pressure of a material is different than the weight of a gas; rather, it's related to how\nlikely a liquid or solid is to lose molecules to the gas phase. If the vapor pressure is higher than\natmospheric pressure, the weight of the atmosphere isn't enough to trap the gas that is released,\nand the material begins to boil.\nSo far, boiling has been entirely described with respect to pressure, but temperature makes a differ\nence too! The vapor pressure also depends strongly on temperature: as temperature rises, the vapor\npressure increases exponentially. So as a material is heated up, its vapor pressure increases until it\nexceeds atmospheric pressure and it starts to boil. For example, if we start with water at 25 C, its\nvapor pressure is about 0.02 atm. By the time it reaches 100°C, the vapor pressure has increased\n50-fold to reach 1 atm, at which point it begins to boil.\nWe learned previously that a higher temperature yields higher kinetic energy and more molecu\nlar movement. However, when a material is \"at\" a certain temperature, not every molecule moves\naround the same. The distribution of kinetic energies associated with a given temperature can be\nvery broad, with long tails. So temperature is used to describe the average kinetic energy, but\nsome molecules will have more and some will have less. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation gives the\nexponential relationship between vapor pressure and temperature:\nln(P ) = -ΔHvap/RT + C\nwhere ΔHvap is the enthalpy of vaporization, or the\nenergy per mole required to convert a liquid molecule\ninto a gas molecule.\nThere is a latent heat or en\nthalpy involved in every kind of phase change: ΔHvap\nfor vaporization, ΔHfus for fusion, and ΔHsub for\nsublimation.\nThe enthalpy of sublimation is al\nways larger than the enthalpy of fusion, because the\nsolid-state atoms/molecules are more strongly bonded\nthan liquid atoms/molecules.\nHess' law tells us\nthat any path from one state to another is a valid\npath, because the total energy required to change\nstates will be the sum of energy differences along the\npath.\nDiagram is in the public domain.\nSource: Wikimedia Commons.\n\nPhase diagrams are helpful to know what the equilibrium phase of a material is at a given tem\nperature and pressure. Phase boundaries are called coexistence curves: at these points, two phases\nexist simultaneously. If a phase boundary is crossed, a phase change will occur. Phase diagrams are\nlike \"maps\" of a material.\nWhy this matters\nHeat is an essential form of energy transfer for human beings, not only for maintaining body tem\nperature but also for a range of primary and advanced activities, from cooking and sterilizing, to\noperating engines and generating electricity. Control of thermal energy to benefit humanity dates\nback to pre-historic times and heat remains the single most valuable energy currency of our exis\ntence. As illustrated in this figure, nearly 90% of all energy consumed globally is either generated\nby or consumed as thermal energy at some point dur\ning the supply/demand cycle.\nIt is therefore surpris\ning, even striking, that to date we have no viable means\nfor storing thermal energy. Unlike mechanical energy,\nwhere material can be simply pumped up a poten\ntial energy hill and held there until needed as in the\ncase of pumped hydro, or electrical energy where elec\ntrons can be pushed up an electrochemical hill and held\nthere as in a battery, for the case of phonons - the\ncarriers of thermal energy - there is no such stabil\nity.\nInstead, thermal energy rolls back down the en\nergy hill and cannot be stopped.\nHeat always dis\nsipates.\nIt leaks and we cannot contain it no mat\nter how hard we work to insulate a thermal reser\nvoir.\nThe slow leaking of thermal energy out of a material that's hotter than its surrounding is called \"sen\nsible heat.\" Eventually, enough energy will be transferred to the environment to make it the same\ntemperature as the surroundings. In fact, if you take a thermodynamics class you'll learn that the\nvery definition of temperature is, \"that which is equal when heat ceases to flow between systems in\nthermal contact.\" So one way to store thermal energy is to heat something up, then that something\nwill leak its heat out at some rate into some environment until its temperature is the same as that of\nthe environment. The storage and release of sensible heat is used all the time, from a heating pack\nthat you microwave and put on your sore neck to focusing sunlight on a concrete slab as in a solar\nthermal power plant, to the old idea of heating an entire mountain for long-term energy generation\nas it slowly cools down. (that last one hasn't been tried yet in case you're wondering. . . but it's\na neat concept!). But whether a heat pack or a mountain, the problem with sensible heat is that\nyou get what you get with almost no control. Apart from how much insulation you package your\nmaterial with, there aren't many good ways to slow and no ways at all to stop the flow of heat.\nBecause in this mode of thermal storage, we heat something up to some temperature and it starts\nHeat conversion diagram (c) source unknown.

For information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/fairuse.\n\ncooling right away, there's also no control over the temperature you get out of the stored energy:\nit's constantly changing as it cools.\nAh, but there is in fact a way to \"hold on\" to thermal energy, and then release it back as heat\nwhen needed, much like electricity in batteries. And it gives you complete and total control over\nthe release temperature. In fact, a simple bucket of wax is a thermal storage system. It works\nby taking advantage of its phase change: when wax melts it changes from solid to liquid, and the\nenergy required to make this phase change happen is large (that would be the enthalpy of fusion,\nΔHfus, as discussed in the lecture). When the wax cools back down it becomes a solid again, and\nall that phase change energy is given back out upon solidification. Materials that are used like\nthis, where the enthalpy of one of its phase changes is used as a way to store and release thermal\nenergy, are called \"phase change materials\" (PCMs). It's a bit of an odd name since all materials are\nphase change materials, but the PCM label has stuck as a way to refer to ones where we try to do\nsomething useful technologically or scientifically with the energy stored/released by the phase change.\nPCM's are used in many applications, including the simple heating pack (which I'll get to in a\nmoment), but also in high temperature applications. Take the molten salts used in solar thermal\npower plants as an example. Sunlight is focused onto a salt or mixture of salts (like sodium and\npotassium nitrate for example), which melts the salt into a liquid during the day. When it cools\ndown at night the now-solidifying salt maintains a precise temperature at its phase change for a\nlong period of time (which is good for a power plant), until it freezes completely back into a solid.\nThere are many other PCM materials and many other uses of PCM materials, and knowing the\nphase diagram so that one can dial in exactly the right temperature of sto red heat release is the\nfirst step to making it possible!\nAnd let me conclude this Why This Matters with one more striking fact. I started by explain\ning that 90% of all energy is generated/consumed as thermal energy. But a massive 60% of the\nheat generated to power our world is wasted! We could capture and recycle much of that energy.\nThere's a lot of interest and research in the development\nof new PCMs with higher storage densities (higher en\nthalpies of fusion), which means new chemistries. The\nability to make a new PCM that possesses all of the\nkey desirable metrics for a given application requires\na deep understanding of the intermolecular interactions\nin the PCM which in turn lead to its phase dia\ngram.\nThere's also exciting new work towards making PCMs\n\"triggerable,\" so that it would stay stuck in the liquid\nstate until some external trigger is applied. Then, when\ntriggered, it would solidify and release all of its phase\nchange energy, ready to be \"charged\" again as a solid.\nThis already happens in some cases, and it takes advan\ntage of the phenomenon of supercooling that we discussed in the lecture.

It stays metastable in a supercooled state,\nuntil some trigger is applied like a little external mechanical force (or an ice cube would do it too).\nThat trigger reminds the material that it actually wants to be a solid at this temperature, in other\nwords it provides a nucleation site for the solid phase, and then since it's a good 30°C below the\nmelting point it all ends up solidifying and giving off all its phase change (enthalpy of fusion) energy.\nThere's a lot of interest and work towards developing new ways to keep PCMs supercooled, which in\nturn could make thermal energy storage look much more like electrical energy storage: triggerable\nand distributable energy on demand. That, in turn, would revolutionize the energy consumption\nlandscape!\nWhy this employs\nHow can a phase diagram get you a job? It's easier than you might have thought! Many companies\nmake and use materials (like, almost all), and in the use of materials many companies have needs.\nThese could mean the development of completely new materials or it could mean the slight tweaking\nof existing materials properties. But either way, the starting place for any materials design is the\nphase diagram of the material. And one place where that starts is in knowing how to calculate phase\ndiagrams. There are companies you could work at that directly make and sell sophisticated software\nto compute phase diagrams (check out thermo-calc or factsage for example), and then there are the\nthousands of companies that post jobs where knowledge of how to use such software is required.\nWant to design new rocket engines? Lockheed has openings where deep knowledge of thermo\ndynamics is required. Or how about the \"thermodynamics engineer\" posting at United Launch\nAlliance (which makes rocket engines too). Or if you want to make buildings more energy efficient\nyou could join PassiveLogic, which is working on, \"developing the next generation control technology\nfor the future of smart cities,\" and is currently seeking a, \"thermodynamics and simulation intern.\"\nOr you could join one of MIT Course 3's spin-outs, Boston Metal, which is working on greener metal\nproduction and has a current opening that requests applicants have a, \"strong understanding of\nthermodynamics/phase equilibrium.\" Of course, this list goes into the thousands because ultimately\nany form of engineering uses materials, and the form of materials used is based on its phase diagram.\n\nExtra practice\n1.

For information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/fairuse.\n\nSolutions\n1. Methanol has the least vapor pressure because its OH group allows it to hydrogen bond to other\nmethanol molecules. Next is hexane because, though it does not have hydrogen bonding capabilities,\nit is more linear than isooctane so can experience greater London dispersion forces. Isooctane has\nthe highest vapor pressure because it has no hydrogen bonding capability and is less stackable than\nhexane so it has less London dispersion forces present.\n2. The ice cubes are at the melting temperature of 0C. Heat transfers from the soda to the ice.\nMelting of the ice occurs in two steps: first the phase change occurs and solid ice transforms into\nliquid water at the melting temperature, then the temperature of this water rises. Melting yields\nwater at 0C, so more heat is transferred from the soda to the water until the water plus soda system\nreaches thermal equilibrium.\nQice = -Qsoda\nThe heat transferred to the ice is:\nQice = mice × Lf + mice × cW × (Tf - 20C)\nBringing all terms involcing Tf on the left-hand-side and all other terms on the right hand side,\nsolve for the unknown quantity Tf :\nmsoda × cW × 20C - mice × Lf\nTf =\n(msoda + mice) × cW\nThe resulting value is 13C.\n3. a) 1-solid, 2-liquid, 3-gas, 4-supercritical fluid, point O-triple point, C-critical point -78.5 °C\n(The phase of dry ice changes from solid to gas at -78.5 °C)\nb) One would see a super-critical fluid, when approaching the point, one would see the menis\ncus between the liquid and gas disappear.\nc) The substance would begin as a gas and as the pressure increases, it would compress and eventually\nsolidify without liquefying as the temperature is below the triple point temperature.\n\nLecture 15: Electronic bands in solids\nSummary\nWhen two atoms come together, their atomic orbitals combine to form a set of bonding and anti-\nbonding molecular orbitals (MOs). When 1024 atoms come together to form a solid, their atomic\norbitals combine to form a continuous band of electronic states. The bands are filled up with\nelectrons: how full they get depends on how many electrons each constituent contributes and how\nclosely spaced in energy the bands are.\nFor example,\nhere is the band energy diagram for Na,\nMg,\nand Al.\nAll of these elements have full 1s,\n2s,\nand 2p bands:\nthese \"core bands\" are therefore com\npletely filled with electrons.\nNa has one additional 3s1 va\nlence electron, which fills up 1/8 of the combined 3s/3p\nband.\nSimilarly,\nMg has valence electron occupation of\n3s2 and Al has 3s23p1 , which fill up the 3s/3p band even\nmore.\nHere, the 3s and 3p bands are shown as one combined band: when\nbands are very close in energy, they can overlap, and essentially\ncombine to form one continuous set of states. When there is an\nenergy gap between the most energetic electrons that live in one\nband and the least energetic electrons that live in the next band,\na band gap forms, like those shown here between 1s and 2s, 2s\nand 2p, and 2p and 3s/3p bands. Note that the term band gap is\nreserved to describe only one of these band gaps, as discussed be\nlow.\nKnowing the band filling tells us a lot about the properties of the solid. If the highest energy\nband is partially filled, the material is a metal. If the highest filled band is completely full of elec\ntrons, then there is a gap between it and the next-highest band: this is the band gap of the material,\nand these solids are called semiconductors. In semiconductors, the highest energy band that is com\npletely filled with electrons is called the valence band, and the next highest unoccupied band is\ncalled the conduction band. If the band gap is very large, say >4 or 5 eV, then the material is\nelectrically insulating.\nThe band gap has a property similar to that in the antibonding MO or nodes in higher-energy\nAOs: namely, all of the energies within the band gap are forbidden, so all of the electrons must\nbe in a band, not in-between. Within a band, electrons can move around: if there is no gap and\nthe material is a metal, it is easy for electrons to freely move around, and conductivity is high.\nIt's harder for electrons to move around in a semiconductor, but it's possible for an electron to get\nan energy boost and transition from one band to another; often, these boosts come from light or\nheat. Of course, it takes less energy to cross a small gap between two states than a large one: it is\nFigure above by B.A. Averill and P. Eldridge in General Chemistry. License: CC BY-NC-SA.\nSource: Open Textbook Library.\n\nmuch more likely for thermal energy (about 0.025 eV/atom at room temperature, 300K) to excite\nan electron into the conduction band of a semiconductor like Si than an insulator like diamond (C).\nElectrons can also be excited into the conduction band via light: semiconductors with energy in\nthe range from about 1.5-3eV can be excited by visible light (about 400-800nm). If a photon's wave\nlength corresponds to just the right energy to match the bandgap, that electron can jump across the\nforbidden energy region. In this case, it jumps to the conduction band and becomes free to move\naround! With this in mind, it is possible to control the flow of electrons across the gap--and the\nconductivity of the semiconductor--with light. If the band gap is larger than the lowest wavelength\nvisible light, the material can't absorb higher-energy photons, and the material is transparent in the\nvisible light range.\nWhy this matters\nThe world we live in uses a lot of light. And in case you haven't noticed, more and more of that\nlight comes from LEDs, or light emitting diodes. Whether it's your phone or laptop or television or\ncar or fridge or house or office or street, odds are the way it lights up is with LEDs. And those work\nbecause they are semiconductors. As discussed in lecture,\na semiconductor forms when the bonding in a material\ntogether with its structural arrangement leads to the for\nmation of a band gap of just the right size (a few eV).\nFrom this we immediately have two well-known devices.\nFirst, electrons in the valence band maximum (VBM) can\nbe excited by light into the conduction band minimum (CBM) where they conduct, a device oth\nerwise known as a photo-detector. Second, we can have the opposite: put electrons into the CBM\nand as they cascade down to the VBM, photons are emitted, a device otherwise known as an LED.\nIn lecture 3, I used television as the topic of Why This Matters and mentioned that the reason\ncolor TV took so long to develop was that stable, inexpensive, red phosphors were a challenge. For\nLEDs it turns out it was also a particular color that delayed their ubiquity, but in this case it was\nblue, on the higher end of the gap. For phosphors it was chemistry that held the key to inventing\nnew molecules that could absorb electrons and shine red. Once again, 50 years later, it was chem\nistry that held the key to unlocking a new material, in this case a semiconductor that could take a\ncurrent of electrons and convert them into blue light. The trick comes in being able to engineer the\nband gap of the solid.\nCheck out this plot of band gap vs. the lattice constant, which is a measure of the spacing be\ntween atoms in a periodically repeating crystal. We'll be digging into crystals in a few weeks, but\nfor now you can consider the x-axis to be simply any structural feature of the solid. The point is\nthat there is a strong dependence, and once this dependence was known and understood, then new\nalloys could be developed with just the right chemistry and therefore structure, to give just the right\nbandgap and therefore color.\nTake a look at GaN on the plot and notice that its bandgap is just a tad too high if we want\n\nblue to be emitted as electrons cascade from its\nCBM to VBM. On the other hand, other materi\nals like InN have bandgaps that are far lower in en\nergy than what is needed to emit blue.\nIt turns\nout that alloying different materials together is one of\nthe most effective ways to \"tune the bandgap,\" and\nthat's exactly how scientists got to blue.\nThey al\nready had red and green, so once they got blue they\nwere able to combine them all together to get white\nLEDs, which have completely taken over the market\nsince.\nThe idea of purposefully modifying the bandgap of a material is called bandgap engineering, and it\nis the centerpiece of the semiconductor revolution. It reaches far beyond LEDs, as the bandgap is a\ncrucial property in lasers, transistors, detectors, and so much more of our electronic world.\nWhy this employs\nHow can knowledge of the band structure of a solid lead to a job? This may, in fact, be the easiest\nWhy This Employs section to write of the whole semester! Semiconductors are so ubiquitous in our\nworld that it's nearly impossible to move without interacting with them. They're in almost any and\nevery electronic device. They're so important some would call this the age of the semiconductor.\nMoore's law depends on making tinier devices out of them each year. They make electricity from\nthe sun. They provide light from electricity. They communicate for us. They compute for us. I\ncould go on.\nThe semiconductor industry is massive and there are many jobs in many companies, and many\nMIT students go on to work in this industry. There are so many jobs in the semiconductor industry\nthat there's a website called semiconductorjobs.com. And many other similar websites. Even more\ninterestingly, the industry is no longer just about making faster chips or specialized chips like for\nwireless communication. It's gotten so much bigger because of all of the various needs for these\nmaterials and devices, from consumer electronics to smart cars to Hollywood to space exploration to\nartificial intelligence. There are jobs related to all of these areas, both in the traditional semiconduc\ntor industry (think, Intel, AMD, Semtech, TI, and dozens more), but also in the companies working\non these applications (think, Bosch, Toyota, Dreamworks, Microsoft, Google, and hundreds, maybe\nthousands more), as well as companies doing both, like Samsung.\nExample Problems\n1.

InSb (band gap 0.16eV) = 7750nm = 7.750 microns\nEach material will absorb light with wavelengths shorter than this band gap wavelength (so ev\nerything to the left of that wavelength on the graph).\nThe InSb absorption spectrum will extend well off the side of the graph (it absorbs EVERYTHING)\n- but because the bandgap of InSb is so small, the electrons it excites don't carry very much energy\n(they lose the excess to heat) so it would be a horrible solar cell.\n3. Top left: all wavelengths absorbed and least thermal energy released.\n\nLecture 16: Semiconductors and Doping\nSummary\nSemiconductors have this name because their conductivity of electrons lie somewhere between\nthose of insulators and metals. The band gap of a semiconductor, meaning the space between its\nconduction band and valence band, is larger than that of a metal but smaller than that of an\ninsulator. Initially, the electrons are bound to the lattice (the arrangement of atoms in the solid)\nand cannot conduct. Their energy states are within the valence band. In order for electrons to\nconduct, they must obtain enough energy to leave the valence band and enter the conduction band,\nwhich involves passing the band gap (forbidden energy states).\nTwo ways in which these initially bound electrons can achieve conduction are via a thermal energy\ntransfer and through doping, which involves introducing impurities (a relatively small number of\nforeign atoms compared to the number of atoms in the lattice) to increase the density of charge\ncarriers (electrons or holes, the absence of an electron which essentially acts as a positive charge).\n(Note: there's a third way we discussed in the last lecture, by kicking electrons above the gap\nusing photons). There are two types of doping, p-type and n-type. P-type doping involves adding\nimpurities with fewer electrons than the atoms in the undoped lattice (i.e. aluminum doped into\nsilicon). P-type doping creates holes. The presence of these holes enables conduction in the lattice\nand the creation of an acceptor energy level.\n\nN-type doping involves adding impurities with more electrons than the atoms in the undoped lattice\n(i.e. phosphorus doped into silicon). N-type doping introduces additional electrons (negative charge\ncarriers). These electrons have an energy corresponding to the donor level, and are able to conduct\nwith a much smaller addition in energy compared to the electrons in the valence band.\nWhy this matters\nThe entire semiconductor industry is built on ways to dope Si, Ge, GaAs, and other semiconduc\ntors with precise amounts of desired impurities, to make n-type and p-type semiconductors which\nthen get put in the billions into a single chip in extremely compli\ncated arrangements.\nThis is how the very first transistor was made,\nby putting an n-type and p-type semiconductor in contact with one\nanother.\nYou can learn all about the very first transistor in so\nmany great resources (like this short video explanation for example,\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBtEckh3L9Q). Here's a picture of that\nvery first transistor, which doesn't look like what you'd see on a computer\nchip today-but it's the first p-n junction and it opened the door to a revolu\ntion.\nJust to get a little perspective: In 2014 250 billion billion transistors were\nmade, which amounts to a pace of 8 trillion transistors per second. Here's a\nchart of what we call\nMoore's law, which isn't a law at all but rather simply what hap\npens when a lot of incredibly smart scientists and engineers work on\nTransistors made per year\nsomething for 60 years.\nvs. price removed due to\ncopyright restrictions.\nSpeaking of smart, how do we, as humans, do our natural comput\ning? How do the computers we make stack up to the brains we use\nto make them? You see, Moore's law looks, and is, impressive, but\nit's a measure of computing power, not power consumption. Data\ncenters alone currently account for 3% of global CO2 emissions and\nestimates are that within 10 years over 20% of all electricity will\nbe consumed by IT. Most of this energy goes into sending current through trillions and trillions of\np-type and n-type semiconductors.\nJust for fun, let's compare the power consumed by a computer that has the equivalent number of pro\ncessors\nas\nthe\nhuman\nbrain.\nA typical adult human brain has about 1011 neurons, or nerve cells, each one connected to about\n10,000 other neurons via connectors called synapses, which are the superhighways of information\nprocessing in the brain. A brain has a total of around 1014 synapses. With 1 transistor being\nequivalent to about 10 synapses, we can build a computer as powerful as the brain, or at least with\nas much computing capacity, with 106 computer chips (each chip packing 10 billion transistors).\nThis would require around 10MW to power. That's 10,000,000 Watts of power needed to run the\nartificial brain. In comparison, the human brain runs on about 20 Watts!\nPhoto of model of the first transistor (c) source unknown.

But we're still short\nanother 6 zeros on power consumption reduction, if we ever want\nto try to match the brain, for which another revolution is clearly\nneeded.\nWhy this employs\nSince I brought up the human brain and compared it to computer chips, let's focus this section on\nthe brain-machine interface. This has been, of course, the subject of many science fiction movies\n(yes, The Matrix), but it's also been the focus of many research labs and government programs for\nat least the past 30 years. This is because of the massive potential in enabling the human-brain\ninterface to help patients with a wide range of neurodegenerative disease. And all of this work has\nbrought us to quite an exciting time in efforts to merge the brain with machines, one in which many\nnew commercial entities are forming.\nElon Musk, for example, launched Neuralink a few years ago. This is a pretty exciting company\nnot only because of its initial concept, but also because they have brought in highly talented and\ninterdisciplinary teams of scientists, doctors, and engineers. Many of the people involved in such\nan effort will need to know about semiconductors and doping, and in this case the serious challenge\nof creating electronics that are \"brain friendly\" (take a look at the work of Professor John Rogers,\nas an example). A number of companies have invested in this area, like Boston Scientific, Abbot,\nBlackrock Microsystems, CorTec, or NeuroNexus, to name only a few. And government programs\nare also growing efforts, for example through DARPA or the NIH BRAIN Initiative.\nExample problems\n1. Doping levels in semiconductors typically range from 1013/cm to 1018/cm , depending on the\napplication. In some devices (like transistors) you need several n- and p-type materials with different\ndoping concentrations.\nSi has a density of 2.328 g/cm . What is the ratio of Si atoms to dopant atoms in 1013/cm\ndoping and 1018/cm3 doping?\na) 1013/cm\nb) 1018/cm\n\n2. You dope Ge with 2.43mg Mg.\na. What kind of doping is this?

How much Ge should you start with if you want a charge carrier density of 1016/cm3 ?\n3. For 13 cm3 of Si, calculate the number of milligrams of B atoms needed in order to have 3.091*10\n17 carriers/cm3. Assume that the dopant only substitutionally incorporates into the Si.\n\nSolutions\n1. To find the ratio between Si atoms and dopant atoms, we need to find the number of Si atoms\nper cubic cm.

The liberated valence electrons are\nfree to move around the fixed cations: they are shared by all of the atoms in the solid, rather than\nfixed to one specific atom. The bonds that form between metal atoms are called metallic bonds.\nUnlike ionic or covalent bonds, where the electrons involved in the bond are closely bound up with\nthe ions, metallic bonds don't belong to one ion or another.\nMetals are characterized by their high electrical conductivity, high thermal conductivity,\nhigh heat capacity, ductility, and luster. Each of these properties can be correlated to the\nelectronic structure and the sea of electrons picture.\nBecause the electronic bands in metals overlap--there is no band gap--electrons can move freely\nthrough the closely-spaced energy states. If an electron at the surface is perturbed, it is easy for the\nenergy to transfer across the solid: the Drude model for conduction relates electron drift to applied\nfield, yielding conductivity. The free electrons can also vibrate, so solid metals can efficiently\ntransfer thermal energy, or heat. The thermal conductivity of metals is directly proportional to\nthe electrical conductivity through the Wiedemann-Franz law. The properties of metals can also be\ncontrolled via alloying. For example, bronze is a metal alloy with Cu and Sn in a 4:1 ratio. Though\nthe presence of Sn lowers the overall conductivity to 10% of pure copper, bronze is much more re\nsistant to corrosion. Brass is a metal alloy with Cu and Zn in a 2:1 ratio. Though the conductivity\nis 28% of pure copper, the brass is much more malleable than pure copper.\nTwo mechanical properties are shared by most metals: malleability and ductility. Both are a measure\nof how much a material can deform without breaking. Malleable materials can be compressed a lot\nwithout breaking, while ductile metals can be stretched a lot without breaking. High malleability\nand ductility allow metallic solids to be drawn into wires, or hammered into complex shapes. For\nexample, a platinum rod 1cm in diameter and 10cm long can be drawn into ≈ 2777 km of wire\njust by pulling. Surprisingly, these mechanical properties can be directly correlated to the electronic\nstructure. As the solid is deformed and ions move around, the sea of electrons can easily move\naround, allowing atoms to rearrange without breaking enough bonds to lead to fracture.\nPeriodic trends in metallic bond strength are directly related to electronic structure. Metallic bonds\nare typically weakest for elements with nearly empty (Cs) or nearly full (Hg) valence subshells, and\nstrongest for elements with half-filled valence shells (W). When the valence band is half-filled with\nelectrons, the ratio of bonding orbitals:antibonding orbitals is maximized. In MO theory, atomic\norbitals combined to form bonding and antibonding states. In the band picture, the bottom of the\nvalence band represents 100% bonding character and the top of the band represents 100% anti-\nbonding character. Therefore, half-filled valence bands yield the strongest metallic bonds. For\ntransition metals, the atomic orbitals are so close in energy that they often overlap, creating wide\nenergy bands with shared characteristics. Metals in groups 6-9 are most likely to have ≈ half-filled\nvalence bands, so the metallic bonds they form are strongest.\n\nWhy this matters\nCorrosion of metals is the worst. The global cost of corrosion is estimated to be $2.5 trillion. Yes,\ntrillion! This is equivalent to 3.4% of the global GDP in 2013. We don't think much about corrosion\nin our day-to-day lives. We think about it as the rusting of the spokes of a bike wheel or some\nold-looking gears.\nBut if a pipe corrodes enough, it\ncan crack.\nIf a boat corrodes enough, it can sink.\nThese are extremely serious problems that involve not\nonly a dramatic loss of money, but also a serious\nsafety risk and potential loss of life.\nIf you dig into\nthe topic of corrosion, you'll find that many indus\ntries have adopted what they call, \"corrosion manage\nment systems.\" What this really means is that they\nare aware it's a big problem, and they're going to\ntry to do something about it.\nBut what can they\ndo?\nThe answer to that question is, of course, chem\nistry.\nAnd because of chemistry,\n$500 billion an\nnually is saved by preventing, or at least dramati\ncally slowing, corrosion.\nMuch more work needs to be\ndone.\nThe automotive industry is an excellent example of an industry that has moved from minimal\ncorrosion control in the 1970's when the life of a car was typically set by the corrosion of the body\nand frame, to state-of-the-art corrosion control through advanced painting/coating technology and\nthe use of corrosion-resistant materials. In this chapter I mentioned the use of alloying as a way to\nmake metals more resilient, with the example of bronze which is copper with a dash of tin. This is\nexactly how anti-corrosion coatings are developed and they can come in the form of paints or addi\ntional metal alloy layers or treatment of existing metal surfaces. Large structural metals like those\nused in bridges or wind turbines are often treated with zinc and aluminum-based coatings to provide\nlong-term corrosion prevention, while many steel and iron fasteners are coated with a thin layer of\ncadmium to block hydrogen absorption, which can lead to stress cracking. Nickel-chromium and\ncobalt-chromium alloys are often used as corrosion prevention coatings because they have very low\nlevels of porosity which makes them extremely resistant to moisture, which in turn inhibits rusting.\nOxide ceramics like alumina (which remember we've already discussed when we talked about ionic\nbonds!) can make excellent and strong coatings.\nThe chemistry of corrosion is a highly active and extremely important area of research, and deeper\nunderstanding of the chemistry of how it happens, as well as how chemistry can be used to prevent\nit, represents a continued massive challenge and enormous opportunity.\nWhy this employs\nHow can metal make a job? Let's go with an example that's a big part of our future, and is actually\nreally cool: 3D printing. Of metals. In a few short years, 3D printing of metals has gone from\nconcept to fringe to near-mainstream. Many companies can now 3D print metal parts and many\nImages of corroded gears are in the public domain. Images of corroded pipeline and ship\n(c) sources unknown.

What kind of people do these companies hire?\nThose who know about the electron sea, of course!\nThere are many companies in this space, including one of our very own, an MIT-based spin-out\ncalled Desktop Metal that formed in 2017. One of the exciting aspects of 3D metal printing is that\nthere's no one standard, at least not yet. So many different companies are working on pushing the\nfrontiers of different technologies, from Desktop Metal which uses something they call Bound Metal\nDeposition, to Concept Laser which sinters metals with a laser and is now owned by GE, to Arcam\n(also now owned by GE) which uses an electron beam to melt the metal, to Xact Metal which uses\nsomething called Powder Bed Fusion, to ExOne which uses something called binder jetting, to Vader\nSystems which utilizes magnetic fields, to Cytosurge which claims nanometer resolution, to many\nmore companies and many more approaches to the printing process. All of these approaches require\ncontinued development of new chemistries (\"inks\") and new ways to manipulate those into tailored,\ncomplex, and high-resolution shapes.\nExample Problems\n1. Metals vs. semiconductors\na) Why are metals better electrical sonductors than semiconductors?\nb) How often do doped semiconductors reach the electrical conductivity levels of metals?\n2. Why is silver (Ag) more electrically conductive than platinum (Pt)?\n3. Rank the following metals in order of increasing metallic bond strength, and explain your rea\nsoning:\nA. Co\nB. Cd\nC. W\nD. Ni\n\nSolutions\n1. a) Metals do not have a band gap, so their electrons can freely conduct, giving rise to the \"sea of\nelectrons\" effect\nb) Doping in semiconductors is never enough to reach the conductivity levels of metals. This is\nbecause the concentration of dopants (the impurities that contribute electrons or holes to the bulk\nmaterial) is extremely small and is not enough to alter the material's band structure.\n2. Ag is more electrically conductive than Pt because of atomic radius-increased atom size leads to\nincreased atomic spacing, which increases electron movement.\n3. Metallic bonds tend to be weakest for elements that have nearly empty or nearly full valence\nshells. They are strongest for those with half-filled valence shells. Therefore,\nweakest: Cd, Ni, Co , strongest: W\n\nLecture 18: The Perfect Solid: Crystals\nSummary\nCrystalline solids possess long-range order: the arrangement of the bonds plays an important role in\ndetermining the properties of crystals.\nEach crystal has a\nunit cell, a repeating unit like a stamp that can be tiled\ninto a pattern.\nOften, there are many unit cells that\ncould be chosen for a given crystal; it's conventional to se\nlect the smallest unit cell that contains all of the neces\nsary information.\nIn the figure, (a), (b), and (c) all show\nvalid unit cells and how they tile, but (d) isn't valid be\ncause when tiled,\nit doesn't cover all the space:\nthere\nare gaps.\nIn 3D space,\nunit cells comprised of vari\nous atomic arrangements give information about crystalline\nsolids.\nThe unit cell also gives information about how\natoms pack together.\nThe packing fraction is a measure of\nhow much of the 2D area of the unit cell is filled up by\natoms:\nPacking fraction = (area occupied by atoms)/(total area available)\nIn 3D space, there are only 7 distinct unit cells\nthat can fill all of space with no voids.\nBravais\nfigured out how to arrange atoms into unit cells;\nit turns out there are only 14 unique Bravais lat\ntices.\nIn 3.091, we'll focus on cubic unit cells,\nwhich have all sides the same length and all angles\n= 90 degrees.\nThere are three distinct cubic unit\ncells.\nThe top row indicates the position of atom centers for\neach of the cubic lattices. Next, the atoms are shown as\nfilling up the maximum amount of volume: this helps to\nvisualize how many atoms are in each unit cell. Finally,\neach of the unit cells are shown in the context of a bigger\nsection of a crystal. Several key metrics help determine\nthe macroscopic properties of a crystal, including the atomic packing fraction (APF) and the coor\ndination number. The atomic packing fraction is calculated in 3D space:\nAPF=( atoms in unit cell)*(volume of atom)/(volume of unit cell)\nThe volume of an atom can be approximated as the volume of a hard sphere: V = 4/3 ∗ π ∗ r .\nFor each of the cubic lattices, the radius of the appropriate hard sphere can be related to the\nlattice constant (width of the unit cell). Finally, the coordination number, or the number of nearest\nneighbors, gives information about how many atoms are available to form bonds. The number of\nUnit cells figure (upper right) (c) source unknown. This content is excluded from our Creative\nCommons license. For information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/fairuse. Cubic lattices diagram\n(lower right) from Chem LibreTexts. License: CC BY-NC-SA.\n\natoms in the unit cell is the sum of the parts of atoms shared between neighboring unit cells. For\nexample, the body-centered cubic (BCC) unit cell has a full atom at the center and also an atom at\neach corner that is shared equally between 8 cells. Therefore, the total number of atoms in a BCC\nunit cell is 8*1/8+1=2 atoms/unit cell.\nWhy this matters\nLet's go back to an application of semiconductors that I mentioned a few lectures ago but didn't\ndelve into. It's about using light energy to excite electrons above the bandgap, and the fact that\nthis means you can harness light as a form of electricity with the right materials. That's called\na solar cell, or a photovoltaic device. Here's the energy we receive on planet earth from the sun.\nWe saw this plot when we gave the example of the ozone molecule as\na key reason we don't receive much UV on the planet (since ozone\nabsorbs it high up in the atmosphere). This time, I'm using the\nplot to show that not only does the intensity strongly depend on\nthe wavelength of light, but much of the energy we receive comes\neither in the visible or the infrared parts of the spectrum. Naively,\nyou may think the best solar cell would simply absorb everything;\nin the language of our bandgap and semiconductor lectures, that\nmeans it would have a very small bandgap, since the smaller the\ngap, the lower the energy of the photon can be to excite an electron\nabove the gap. In a solar cell, once an electron is excited above the\ngap, that negative charge then gets extracted out of the device from the conduction band, while the\npositive hole gets extracted from the valence band. Those extracted charges can then do work (like\ncharge your phone).\nAh, but were it only so easy! The challenge is that once the electron is excited it very quickly\n\"thermalizes\" down all the way to the bottom of the conduction band. It's a process that happens\nso quickly that there's very little we can do about it (although there is an active area of research to\nextract \"hot electrons\" out of materials, before they can ther\nmalize, but no working devices at this point).\nThis ther\nmalization means that the amount of energy the electron can\nhave when it is ready to do work, no matter how high in\nenergy the photon was that excited it, is equal to the en\nergy of the band gap.\nThat's shown here in this energy di\nagram as the blue squiggly line.\nA photon of this blue en\nergy would be absorbed by the material, and the excited elec\ntron wouldn't lose any energy since it didn't go higher than\nthe bandgap.\nBut if a higher frequency light is absorbed,\nlike that purple squiggle, then the photon still creates an\nexcited electron in the material, although any excess energy\nabove the bandgap is lost, since the electron quickly drops\ndown to the conduction band minimum before it can be ex\ntracted.\nFigures above (c) sources unknown. All rights reserved. This content is excluded from our\nCreative Commons license. For information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/fairuse.\n\nOn the other hand, if the photon that comes in has an energy lower than the bandgap, say that green\nsquiggle in the diagram, then it won't be absorbed at all (no states are present to be excited into).\nAnd here is why understanding the chemistry of solar cells is so important, for we have competing\ndrivers: the lower the gap, the more of that spectrum can be absorbed, but the less energy the\nelectron has to do work and the more energy lost to thermalization, while the higher the gap the\nmore energy the electron has in that CBM, but fewer photons can be absorbed. This is because,\nas we learned, the semiconductor can only absorb light equal or greater in energy to its band gap.\nThis trade-off means there's an optimal bandgap for a solar cell made from one single material, and\nthat optimal gap is right around 1.3 eV. That's quite close to the bandgap of silicon, which is 1.1eV.\nYes, but that is only if we have a perfect crystal! In fact, silicon could have a much lower bandgap,\ndepending on how good of a crystal it is. If it has defects (these are interruptions in the lattice\nand stay tuned, that topic is coming soon!), then the bandgap can go way down, with the limit\nbeing that silicon could even become metallic if the crystallinity is messed up too much. This ex\nplains part of the reason why silicon has been expensive and also has to go onto glass as opposed\nto plastic substrates: namely, because a silicon solar cell has to be made very thick (100's of microns).\nThe truth of the matter is that silicon is a terrible light absorber. That's right, the solar cell\nmaterial that dominates the world market at > 85% is horrible at doing one of the most important\nthings it needs to do: absorb sunlight. Silicon is still is capable of absorbing, of course, but it's just\ninefficient so it just has to be made very thick in order to capture all of the light. Compare that\nto other materials that can absorb light efficiently like a dye molecule, which could absorb all the\nsun's energy in 1000x thinner layers. The thickness of silicon is a double-whammy: first, it means\nthe solar cell is brittle, cannot bend, and must go on glass which makes the whole device heavy,\nand 2) it means the excited charges have a much further distance to travel in the material before\nthey can reach an electrode and be extracted for work. And that means high cost, since it's a lot of\nmaterial that needs to be made as perfectly crystalline as possible. It can be (almost) done, but it's\ndifficult, expensive, and requires huge fabrication plants. But getting that quality, that crystallinity\nover large distances (yes, microns are very large distances for an electron or an atom!), is worth it\nbecause crystallinity holds the key to the semiconductor properties. In this case, it's the electron\ntransport we're talking about, and the more ordered and crystalline the lattice is, the better for the\ncharges to move around.\nWhy this employs\nSince this lecture is all about crystallinity, let's take a look at the employment opportunities in\nmaking crystals.\nIt is true that you can dig up rocks from the\nground and they may already have crystalline order in them, like the\ninside of this rock shown here.\nBut most of the time these crys\ntals are useless for technology since they contain all sorts of orien\ntations all jumbled up together, they often have a lot of defects in\nthem, and also they're usually not pure elements but rather miner\nals containing the element of interest along with impurities (like oxy\n\ngen).\nSo the question is:\nhow does one make as pure of a crystal\nas possible out of a single element?\nLet's take silicon as an exam\nple.\nHere's a figure of all the steps that it takes to\nturn sand into crystalline silicon.\nAs you can\nsee, there are a lot of them, and many involve\nhigh temperatures or chemical mixing.\nA lot of\ncompanies operate at different stages of this chart.\nFor example, getting from sand to \"metallurgical\ngrade silicon\" is something a lot of smaller com\npanies do, like Mississippi Silicon, Elkem, or Sili\ncon Materials, Inc., to name only a few.\nThese\nare often companies with a few hundred employ\nees so they may not have a large number of job\npostings, but there are many companies so if you\ndo a deep dive into the full landscape of silicon\nproducers you'll likely find some good opportuni\nties.\nOnce a company has made high enough purity silicon, they\ncan then mold it into an ingot. This also requires further\npurification and also again high temperatures. Most of\nthe companies that make high-purity ingots are currently\nbased in China, although there are others scattered around the world including in places like Japan,\nGermany, and Korea. And once there's an ingot, it can be sliced into wafers that can then be\nmade into devices. Here we have a lot of large companies specializing in this process, like Applied\nMaterials or Lam Research, among many others.\nExample problems\n1.

In the last\nlecture, we placed a single atom at each lattice site, and from there we could calculate atomic pack\ning fraction. However, anything could be placed at the lattice sites, as long as the same thing is put\nat every lattice site. The lattice is \"how\" to repeat; \"what\" to repeat is called the basis. The unit\ncell serves as a way to think about where we are in the crystal.\nFor points in the lattice, Cartesian coordinates (h,k,l) are used: convention\nally, they're scaled by the lattice constant. A direction within the crystal is\ndescribed by a vector: these vectors always start at the origin, so directions are\ncompletely described by the end point of the vector, which lies on a face of the\nunit cell. The notation is slightly different for crystallographic vectors: the end\npoints are scaled to all be integers, and they're enclosed by brackets with no\nspaces, [hkl]. For example, the vector from (0,0,0) to (1/2,1,0) in the diagram\nis the crystallographic direction [120]. This notation is called Miller Indices.\nA negative direction is indicated with an overbar: the vector from (0,0,0) to\n(-1,0,0) is written as [\nIn a cubic system, all directions with the same set\n100].\nof Miller Indices are equivalent, regardless of order: these can be grouped into\nfamilies of directions: these are indicated with angle brackets, hhkli.\nMiller indices can also be used to describe crystallographic planes, which can be determined by\nfollowing 4 steps:\n1. Read off the points at which the plane intercepts the axes in terms of fraction of the unit cell\nlength\n2. Take reciprocals of the intercepts\n3. Divide by the greatest common factor to yield integer values\n4. Enclose in parentheses, with no commas (hkl)\nFor example, this plane intercepts the x-axis at x=1, the y-axis at y=1,\nand it never crosses the z-axis,\nso the z intercept is z=inf.\nThe\nreciprocals of these values are 1,\n1,\nand 0,\nso thus is the (110)\nplane.\nA family of planes in the cubic system contains all of the planes with the same\nset of Miller Indices but in any order. Families of planes are indicated by curly\nbrackets, {hkl}.\nThe packing density in a given plane is calculated as\nPlanar packing density = ( atoms in the plane)/(area of the plane) [atoms/area]\nNote that the planar packing density is not the same as the planar packing fraction, which is unitless!\nFinally, the distance between planes described by the same set of Miller indices, d, can be determined\nDiagram of Miller Indices and (110) plane (c) sources unknown.

Notice that when it's stretched, it has those tilted disc-\nlike shapes. That's because it breaks along the Miller planes that\nhave the lowest packing density since those are most weakly bonded.\nNot only does this inform us as to when a crystalline material will\nbreak, but it gives us the atomic-scale picture of how it breaks and\nwhat shape it takes as it breaks. Now, a lot of solids may not\nhave large differences in the energy required to break different Miller\nplanes, so this type of phenomenon may not occur when it's under\ntensile strain. For many metals the bonds are not so directional\nand the material can simply deform easily because of that sea of\nelectrons accommodating the stretch (remember that wire drawing\nexample from Lecture 16?). Then there's the other end of the spectrum, where a material is so\nanisotropic that in one direction the planar density and bonding type are completely different than\nin the other directions. Graphite (pictured here) is a beautiful example of this.\nThin long wires can be made out of graphite, too. In fact, carbon fibers, as they're called, make up\na $1.7B market today, and it's a market that's growing strong. If we could just get the cost down\nby about a factor of 10 or so, then carbon fibers would be able to compete with materials like steel\non cost while being stronger, lighter, and more resilient. Just for comparison, today's carbon fibers\nare 10x stronger than steel while being 5x lighter! If the cost of carbon fibers could be lowered,\nthen we'd replace everything we could with them because they're just that good. Carbon fibers\nare not graphite but they are like graphite, in the sense that they have large sp2-bonded planes of\ncarbon that are aligned together. But in order to give it added strength either the planes are kind\nof crumpled, or they're bonded to one other through covalent links. Either way, it's the ability to\nengineer the chemistry of the Miller planes that makes all the difference.\nGems and micrograph of wire deformation (c) source unknown. All rights reserved.

For information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/fairuse.\n\nWhy this employs\nLet's keep going with the carbon fibers concept from the Why This Matter section above. As I\nmentioned, carbon fibers could completely revolutionize structural materials and make so many as\npects of our lives lighter, stronger, and more efficient. But a lot of work is yet to be done on the\nfibers themselves to lower their cost, as well as to integrate them into other products, from fabrics\nto plastics to concrete to metal. A lot of companies are doing extremely interesting work related\nto these problems. And yes, it all starts from a solid understanding of those Miller planes and\ncrystallographic directions.\nHexcel has annual revenue over $2B and their flagship product is carbon fiber and composites.\nNote that both their name as well as logo are all about those hexagons in graphite! Hexcel is also\ncool because on their website they directly list student internship opportunities. Another company\nin this space is Solvay which makes thousands of products, many of which involve crystal planes of\ngraphite. There's Toray, with its origins in race cars, which lists carbon fibers as one of their 5 core\nbusinesses, and there's Nippon Steel which has a whole subsidiary devoted to Granoc, a light-weight\nfabric or yarn made from carbon fibers. Its proprietary carbon fiber chemistry, they promise, is,\n\"spinning the future.\"\nExample Problems\n1. Give the Miller indices of the shaded plane:\n2.

Wilhelm Rontgen first discovered x-rays by observing electrons striking a\nmetal target in a cathode ray tube. Electrons were emitted from a heated filament and directed by\nan electric field inside the tube to very high velocities.\nWhen\nthe high-speed electrons strike metal atoms, two kinds of x-\nrays are generated.\nContinuous x-ray radiation is caused\nby the deflection of an incoming electron as it interacts\nwith a metal target atom:\nas the name suggests, the al\nlowed wavelengths for the Bremsstrahlung (which translates\nX-ray Continuum Radiation\nto \"braking radiation\") are a continuous spectrum above a\n(Brehmsstrahlung) figure removed\ndue to copyright restrictions.\nlower bound.\nThe lower bound on wavelength (upper bound\non energy) is set by the energy of the incoming elec\ntron, because the energy of the emitted x-ray cannot be\ngreater.\nThe second type of x-ray that can be generated is a product of the\nelectronic structure of the metal target atoms. When a high-energy\nelectron is incident on a metal atom, it can knock out an electron\nin the inner core of the target atom, allowing a higher energy core\nelectron to cascade down. If the electron cascades down from the\nn=2 to the n=1 energy level, the photon that's emitted is called an alpha photon. These x-rays are\ndiscrete: they occur at a single wavelength that corresponds to the difference in energy levels.\nCrystallographers use a slightly different notation for the energy levels within an atom: the ground\nstate (n=1) is called the K shell, n=2 is the L shell, and n=3 is the M shell. Using this notation,\na photon that is emitted via the process of an electron falling from n=2 to n=1 is called a K-alpha\nphoton. The energy difference between inner-shell electrons is huge- that's why the photons that\nare emitted are x-rays.\nHeavier elements have bigger differences between the\nenergy levels, so the K-alpha wavelength is smaller.\nIt is therefore possible to determine which kind of\natom the x-ray was emitted from, just by knowing the\nwavelength:\nthese x-rays are called characteristic x-\nrays.\nIn this plot, the Brehmsstrahlung and the characteristic\nx-rays are shown together, as they'd be measured. The\nfirst two peaks are the K-beta (M to K) and K-alpha (L\nto K) lines, since those correspond to the biggest energy\ntransitions within the atom. Then come the L-beta (N to L) and L-alpha (M to L) lines, which\nX-ray spectrum figure (c) source unknown. All rights reserved. This content is excluded from our\nCreative Commons license. For information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/fairuse.\n\nare much smaller energy gaps. The intensity can be changed by changing the number of electrons\nthat are incident on the target. The lower-bound Brehmsstrahlung wavelength can be changed by\nadjusting the kinetic energy of the incident electrons, though this wouldn't change the location of\nthe characteristic x-ray peaks at all. The only way to shift the characteristic x-rays is to change the\ntarget metal used to generate the x-rays. If the energy of the incident x-rays is too low, though, no\ncharacteristic x-rays would appear: the incident electrons must have enough energy to knock out a\ncore electron to kick off the cascade.\nWhy this matters\nThe discovery of x-rays, and the subsequent ability to fully control what wavelength of x-ray is gen\nerated, has had so much impact on modern life that it's really tough to choose only one example for\nWhy This Matters.\nBut I guess since I have to pick, I may\nas well go back to the roots of Rontgen himself and one of the\nvery first ways he used his new rays.\nThat would be to take\na picture of his wife!\nMore precisely, her hand -\nit's the first\nx-ray picture ever taken and it started a revolution (The black\ncircle on the second finger from the left is her ring,\nby the\nway).\nThe key thing about x-rays, which Rontgen noticed right away, is that they\nare able to pass through soft body tissue like skin and flesh, but they get ab\nsorbed by the denser material like bone. This means that if you shine x-rays\non a body part, the bones inside cast shadows, which can be captured with a\nphotographic plate. This was an incredible advance for medicine because for\nthe first time a doctor could see inside a living patient without having to cut\nthe patient open. Some of the earliest users of x-rays in medicine were military\ndoctors, who could use them to optimize removal of bullets from a wounded soldier. As doctors saw\nhow useful they could be, x-rays became central to diagnosis and by the 1930s\nthey had led to the specialized field of radiology.\nNot only are x-rays currently utilized routinely in many aspects\nof medicine, but the technology of x-ray imaging continues to im\nprove dramatically.\nBeyond improved contrast in the images, one\nvery recent breakthrough applies techniques originally developed for\nthe Large Hadron Collider in Geneva,\nwhich is still the world's\nlargest particle accelerator at 27 km long.\nWith a combination\nof advanced shutters, cameras, and software, a completely new type of x-ray imaging\nis possible, with 3D and color images. Take a look at this very\nfirst x-ray picture of teeth, taken in 1896 with a 9-minute exposure\ntime (!). Now look at a modern-day x-ray picture of teeth next to\nit. That's an incredible improvement, and even more so when you\nrealize that the picture on the right is fully 3D and a dentist can\nspin it around to see all angles.\nFirst medical x-ray by Wilhelm Rontgen of his wife Anna Bertha Ludwig's hand is in the public\ndomain.

For information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/fairuse.\n\nWhy this employs\nThere's a whole lot of X-ray generation that goes on in the world,\nand the medical imaging example I gave above in Why This Matters is only one part of it. For\nexample, X-rays are also used as scanners at airports, or as ways to do quality control for many\nindustrial parts, or to analyze the degradation of valuable paintings, or in the field now called \"X-ray\nastronomy,\" to name only a few examples. X-rays are also used not only to see an illness like cancer,\nbut also to treat it (\"radiation therapy\"). Just the medical market for X-rays alone is set to surpass\n$16.5B globally by 2025. And all these uses for X-rays spells jobs.\nThere are many companies out there that make X-ray equipment. Siemens for example sells 6 dif\nferent types of \"digital X-ray equipment,\" but that's just one category - they've also got a robotic\nX-ray machine, as well as two types of CT scanners (yes those also use X-rays), and a fluoroscopy\nmachine which uses X-rays to examine movement. And that's just one company! Siemens is a very\nlarge company, with the subsidiary \"Siemens Healthineers\" making this type of equipment. 41% of\ntheir US workforce of 13K people is in RD, engineering, IT, or tech support. And there are many\nothers: Philips, GE Healthcare, Hitachi Healthcare America, Medtronic, Samsung Medical Devices,\nEizo, Xoran Technologies, and United Imaging, Canon Medical Systems, and I'm still just getting\nstarted. All of these companies are selling wide ranges of X-ray equipment and they're all competing\nwith one another for customers, which means they're constantly trying to improve their technology\nand differentiate what they're selling from their competitors. And beyond these large companies,\nthere are many small-scale companies looking to innovate the field. For example the company MARS\nBioimaging, based in New Zealand, is commercializing the 3D color X-ray technology that came out\nof the Hadron Collider.\nAnd that's just the equipment side. There are also all the companies working on new software\nto analyze the images produced by all this X-ray equipment. For example, there are many start-ups\napplying AI to analyze the X-ray image data and in some cases AI has been shown to perform better\nthan human doctors!\n\nExample problems\n1.

All of\nthe material listed on this concept map is fair game for Exam 3.\n\nLecture 21: Bragg's Law and x-ray Diffraction\nSummary\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) ) is a method used for characterizing solids. It relies on the diffraction of\nx-rays upon striking crystal planes (the Miller planes we've learned about!) By assuming that each\nplane of atoms is continuous, and that they reflect the incoming x-rays such that the incident angle\nand the reflected angle are equal, the Braggs derived the equation that bears their name and relates\nthe distance between repeating planes (d) and the x-ray angle of incidence (θ) to the x-ray wave\nlength:\nTwo x-rays striking equivalent Miller planes with the same angle of\nincidence will constructively interfere if the additional distance that\none of the travels is equal to the wavelength of the x-ray. Quan\ntitatively, if λ = 2dsinθ, the intensity of the outgoing x-rays with\nwavelength λ are enhanced. the constructive interference will oc\ncur whenever the path length distance is an integer multiple of the\nwavelength: 2dsinθ = nλ for integer n. For 3.091, we'll assume\nn = 1. When constructive interference occurs, a signal will reach\nthe detector in the XRD machine and a peak will be observed in\na plot of the x-ray intensity. For destructive interference, no peak\nwill be observed. Knowing the angle that gives rise to a peak as\nwell as the wavelength of the incident x-rays allows us to obtain the\ndistance between the planes that produced the reflection. This is known as the Bragg condition:\n2dhklsinθhkl = λ\nFor a given Miller plane, denoted by (hkl), the Bragg condition is\nsatisfied by a pair (d, θ) of inter-planar spacing and incident an\ngle.\nFor each of the crystal structures (SC, BCC, or FCC), there are\nreflections that even when the Bragg Condition is met lead to de\nstructive interference, due to crystal symmetry. The pattern of peak\nabsences was used to derive a set of rules called selection rules,\nwhich allow us to know, or at least narrow down the possibilities of,\nthe crystal structure of a material based on its XRD peaks. For the\ncase of SC, there are no rules and any plane is fine. There are no\nforbidden reflections.\nFor the case of BCC, allowed reflections are those where h+k+l is an even number. Forbidden\nreflection are those for which h+k+l is an odd number. For the case of FCC, allowed reflections are\nthose where h,k,l are all odd or h,k,l are all even. Forbidden reflections of FCC are those where h,k,l\nis mixed odd/even.\nSRD graphic, Bragg diffraction (c) sources unknown. All rights reserved.

For information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/fairuse.\n\nWhy this matters\nFor solids, sructure can be as important as the chemistry itself, and they are deeply connected. When\nI look up the crystal structure of a element in the Periodic Table I see what it is for the ground\nor lowest energy state of that element. This is the overall \"happy place,\" energetically speaking,\nof the material. But materials can take on other, metastable structures and be very happy there,\ntoo. And Why This Matters is because the properties can be completely different depending on\nwhich crystal structure the material takes, and XRD is the single most important characterization\nmethod we have to determine crystal structure. We've already seen the difference between graphite\nand diamond, which contains the same exact element (carbon) but just arranged in a different struc\nture. The same is true for, well, pretty much everything. Take another element, iron, as an example.\nHere's a phase diagram for iron. As you may\nremember from Lecture 14, a phase diagram is\na plot of the different phases of a material as\na function of some variables, in this case pres\nsure and temperature. Notice that at normal, or\n\"ambient,\" temperature (≈300K) and pressure\n(≈1 bar) conditions, iron is a BCC crystal. This\nis also what you'll find if you look up its crystal\nstructure in the PT. But notice from reading the\nphase diagram that if we raise the temperature\nit becomes FCC, and if we raise the pressure it\ngoes into the HCP (it's not cubic so we haven't\nIron phase diagram (lower right) (c) source unknown. All rights reserved. This content is excluded\nfrom our Creative Commons license. For information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/fairuse.\n\ncovered it) phase. Fun fact: if you keep raising the temperature eventually it will go back to being\nBCC.\nThe reason all of this matters is that the structure changes the properties. In the case of iron,\nthe element's magnetic properties are affected. If it's FCC then it will be 'antiferromagnetic' as\nopposed to the BCC 'ferromagnetic' behavior. I reommend taking a magnetics course in the future\nto learn more about these terms! This has huge implications in magnetic technologies. And I know\nyou're probably thinking: sure, but we don't build too many iron-based technologies that operate at\n1000K! You're right, but the trick is that often times we can coax these materials to get stuck in one\nof those metastable phases and then use it for technologies while it's in that phase. Again, diamond\nis a great example: it's not the ground state of carbon so it is metastable as diamond instead of\ngraphite, but we know that it stays stuck there for a long time so for most technologies that use\ndiamond (say, a piece of jewelry), we don't worry about it changing out of its metastable phase.\nComing back to the topic of the lecture, when we make something, whether that something is\nas old as elemental iron or as new as a nanostructured perovskite, the simplest and most common\nway we have to tell its crystal structure is by XRD. In some cases, the use of XRD can unravel the\nstructural mystery of a material, as in the case of the double-helix for DNA or the many proteins\nsince. In other cases, it's used to not unlock the secret to a completely new structure, but rather to\nclassify a material into one or the other well-known structures. Sometimes the reason is to under\nstand a material, sometimes it's to engineer the material properties, and often times it's both. But\nwhatever the motivation, this incredibly powerful characterization tool has revolutionized what we\nknow about solids.\nWhy this employs\nWe've been referencing these crystallographers (who are very picky about notation!) for several\nlectures now. But who are these people? And more to the point: who hires them? A whole\nlot of X-ray crystallographer jobs are out there in the biotech industry, in companies of all sizes.\nBlueprint Medicines, which looks like a Harvard spin-out and is just down the street, has an open\ning now with the title, \"Senior Scientist/Principal Scientist, X-Ray Crystallography,\" with the first\njob function description being, \"Provide x-ray crystallographic and protein structure-function sup\nport, including structure-based drug design, to on-going drug discovery projects and new target\ndiscovery initiatives.\" And the larger pharmaceutical and biotech companies have even more jobs.\nTake Novartis, which also has a big headquarters near MIT, just down Mass Ave. They're hiring\npeople to perform \"crystallography experiments including crystallization screening using automated\nliquid handling. GlaxoSmithKline has an opening for someone to \"enable higher throughput x-ray\ncrystallography.\" Johnson and Johnson is hiring people with X-ray crystallography expertise to do,\n\"automated chemistry.\" And I have to mention one last example because of the title of their cur\nrent opening, Bristol-Myers-Squibb is looking for a, \"Research Investigator, Solid-State Chemistry.\"\nGotta love it! They want, \"an entry level scientist with background in X-ray crystallography, X-ray\ndiffraction, and solid-state characterization.\" That's now you!\nAnd it's not all about pharma. Hospitals are hiring X-ray crystallographers too (these are not\n\nthe same position as a radiologist), to work on research projects for example with openings at Mass\nGeneral and Dana Farber. And many research positions in X-ray diffraction are out there too,\nfrom positions at the Howard Hughs Medical Institute to university labs and centers all across the\ncountry.\nExample Problems\n1.

To answer these\nquestions, we need our handy Miller plane separating distance equation (where 'd' is the distance\nbetween two repeating Miller planes with indices hkl in a cubic system, and 'a' is the lattice con\nstant):\na\ndhkl = √\nh2 + k2+2\nand the Bragg condition:\n2dhklsinθhkl = λ\nNotice that both of these equations include dhkl. We can use this to our advantage and substitute\none equation for dhkl into another to obtain the following:\nλ 2\n(sinθhkl)2\n=\n2a\nh2 + k2 + l2\nWe know the value of the wavelength, because it is fixed by the Ka x-rays from the copper source.\nThese x-rays have a wavelength of 1.54 A. So the expression for our example becomes:\n1.54 A 2\n(sinθhkl)2\n=\n2a\nh2 + k2 + l2\nNow we have constants on both sides of the equal sign, because the lattice parameter does not\nchange. We can make an educated guess of the hkl value by following the procedures outlined in\nthe chart on the following page.\n\nFrom the selection rules we know that Al is an FCC metal, since the (hkl) combinations are al\nways either all even or all odd. We can also take a value of θand a value of h, k, and l and plug these\ninto the equation above to find the lattice parameter, given in the rightmost column of the chart.\nWhy this matters\nThis is Henry Moseley (image, Royal Society of Chemistry). He's pictured there in his lab, holding\nin\nhis\nhands,\nof\ncourse,\na\nmodified\ncathode\nray\ntube.\nHe\nwas experimenting with X-rays.\nBut Moseley's interests were less\nabout the crystal structures and Bragg conditions and more about\nthe X-ray lines themselves and what they meant.\nHe carried\nout a systematic study of the metals used to generate the X-\nrays, comparing the X-ray emission from 38 different chemical ele\nments.\nSome work had already been done that led to our understanding of the charac\nteristic and continuous parts of the X-ray generation spectrum, as we discussed\na few lectures ago. But a full systematic study had not been carried out until\nMoseley's work. Take a look at the difference between the two X-ray spectra\ngenerated with two different targets: Mo and Cu. Note the Kα and Kβ lines\nfor each one, and that they're shifted to lower wavelength for Mo compared\nPhoto of Henry Moseley\nis in the public domain.\n\nto Cu.\nAs we know, this is because of difference in en\nergy between the shells of n=1 and n=2 (for Kα) or n=1\nand n=3 (for Kβ ), and it makes sense this energy differ\nence is greater (corresponding to lower wavelength) for Mo\nsince it's heavier than Cu.\nBut what exactly is the de\npendence, and why is it present?\nLet's look at the data\nfor a sequence of targets, directly from a subset of Moseley's\ndata.\nThese are characteristic X-ray lines for Ca up through Zn, so going\nacross the d-block elements of the fourth row in the PT. Note that\nit's not actually Zn but rather brass, which we've already learned\nis a mixture of Zn with Cu - that's because Zn would melt under the high energy electron bom\nbardment before it could give off any characteristic X-rays, so Moseley gave it the extra strength it\nneeded by making brass, and then subtracted out the emission from Cu. Nice trick!\nWhat Moseley found was that if the characteristic emission lines were plotted as the square of\ntheir energy vs. atomic number, that you'd get a straight line. He fit the data by considering the\nlines to come from a core excitation, so a difference in energy levels from Bohr's model:\n\nEx-ray = 13.6[eV ](Z - 1)2\n-\n= (13.6[eV ])(Z - 1)2\nThis is now called Moseley's law. Can you see why it's Z-1 instead of Z as in the Bohr model? It's\nbecause the electron cascading down to generate the X-ray is \"seeing\" a 1-electron screening of the\nnucleus. That's because one of those core 1s electrons was knocked out, but there's one left there\nthat screens out a positive charge, hence the Z-1. So what did this trend in the data mean? Here's\nwhat Moseley said in his 1913 paper, \"We have here a proof that there is in the atom a fundamental\nquantity, which increases by regular steps as one passes from one element to the next. This quantity\ncan only be the charge on the central positive nucleus, of the existence of which we already have\ndefinite proof.\"\nThe reason this is such a big deal, and why I'm making it the Why This Matters for this chap\nter, is that even through the Mendeleev periodic table had been around and more elements were\nbeing discovered and added, there was a major flaw in the periodic table: the position predicted by\nan element's atomic weight did not always match the position predicted by its chemical properties.\nRemember that the positioning by Mendeleev was based on weight and properties and when the\nperiodicity called for it, he chose to order the elements based on their properties, rather than their\natomic weight. But was there something more fundamental than atomic weight?\nMoseley's data only made sense if the positive charge in nucleus increased by exactly one unit\nas you go from one element to the next in the PT. In other words, he discovered that an element's\natomic number is identical to how many protons it has! I know this seems kind of obvious to us now,\nbut back then \"atomic number\" was simply a number with no meaning, other than the element's\nplace in the periodic table. The atomic number was not thought to be associated with any measur\nCharacteristic x-ray figure (c) source unknown. All rights reserved. This content is excluded from\nour Creative Commons license.

This led to a much deeper understanding of the periodic table\nand his insights immediately helped to understand some key mysteries, for example where to place\nthe lanthanides in the PT (La = #57, Lu = #71), or why Co comes before Ni. And the gaps that\nMendeleev brilliantly left open in his PT to create periodicity now made sense by missing atomic\nnumbers in a sequence, for example elements 43, 61, 72, and 75 were now understood to contain that\nmany protons (they were discovered later by other scientists: technetium, promethium, hafnium and\nrhenium).\nMoseley died tragically in 1915 at age 27 in a battle in WW1. In 1916 no Nobel Prizes were\nawarded in physics or chemistry, which is thought to have been done to honor Moseley, who surely\ndeserved one.\nWhy this employs\nWe've covered X-ray generation and machine manufacturers two chapters ago, and in the last chapter\nwe looked at jobs related to X-ray crystallography. For this last Why This Employs related to X-\nrays, it's time to go big or go home. And when I say big, I mean really big. When electrons or for\nthat matter any charged particles are accelerated to near light speeds, then the acceleration they\nexperience simply to stay in a loop produces massively energetic radiation. The wavelength can\nvary dramatically, but very often these enormous accelerators are used to make super-high-energy\nX-rays. The intensity of these rays is dazzlingly bright, millions of times brighter than sunlight\nand thousands of times more intense than X-rays produced in other ways. This level of brightness\nmakes them useful for pretty much any and all areas of research and fields of science. Some types\nof measurements are only possible when synchrotron light is used, and for other types one can get\nbetter quality information in less time than with traditional light sources. They've been shown\nto be useful in so many areas it's impossible to list them all, but certainly in biology, chemistry,\nphysics, materials, medicine, drug discovery, and geology, to name only a few fields, synchrotrons\nhave made a dramatic impact. They're in such demand that often one needs to book time on them\nmany months in advance. A typical synchrotron can have as many as 50 \"beam lines\" that grab\nthe high energy X-rays out of the loop and focus them in a beam where experiments are done.\nThese lines are usually booked and put to use 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, all year round.\nHere's a photo of one of them, the Advanced Photon Source\nat Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois.\nTheir tagline\noverview statement reads,\n\"The Advanced Photon Source\n(APS) at the U.S. Department of Energy's Argonne Na\ntional Laboratory provides ultra-bright, high-energy storage ring-\ngenerated x-ray beams for research in almost all scientific disci\nplines.\"\nThe Employment part of this is pretty cool. These facilities, which\nare called \"synchrotrons,\" are all over the world, and they require\nthousands of people to build and then run. The international nature of them is astounding: just\ndo a image search for synchrotron and you'll find pictures of them all over the planet. And that\nPhoto of Argonne National Laboratory is in the public domain (Source: Department of Energy).\n\nmeans jobs in many different locations. Some are old, like the one at Berkeley National Lab (but\nit's still kicking!), some are medium-sized like that APS pictured above, and some are huge like the\nHadron Collider I referenced in the last lecture as a place where 3D X-ray imaging was invented.\nColliders are also synchrotron light sources, since they're built to accelerate particles at very high\nspeeds. Even though colliders may be used to smash particles together at these speeds, they're also\noften used simply as a way to generate high intensity light.\nI don't have a specific job title in mind, but if you look at a list like this one:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_synchrotron_radiation_facilities\nyou'll see where these synchrotrons are, and for each one of them there's an \"employment\" link you\ncan click on to explore possible jobs.\n\nExtra practice\n1. Determine the element that made up the sample from Lecture 21 Extra Practice Problem 1. The\nXRD pattern is reproduced below (copper ka x-rays were used).\n2. You would like to perform an XRD experiment, but you don't know what target is used in\nthe diffractometer in your lab. You put in a calibration sample of iron, which is BCC and has a\nlattice parameter of 2.856 angstroms. If you observe the following XRD pattern, what material is\nthe target? You are pretty sure that there is a filter that prevents anything with lower energy than\nka radiation from hitting your sample.\nThe peaks observed are as follows:\na) What kind(s) of x-rays are hitting the sample?\nb) How many planes are represented by the data? Which planes are they?\nc) What are the interplanar spacings associated with these planes?\nd) Which element was used as the target?\nNi XRD figure (c) source unknown. All rights reserved.

There are four types\nof point defects: vacancies, interstitial impurities, self-interstitials, and substitutional impurities.\nArrhenius determined a law for the temperature dependence of the rate at which processes occur:\n/RT\n/kB T\nk = Ae-Ea\n= Ae-Ea\nwhere R is the gas constant (or kB is the Boltzmann constant) and Ea is the activation energy.\nThe term in the exponent should be unitless: therefore, if the activation energy is given in J/mol,\nuse the version with R, but if the activation energy is given in J, use the KB version. Recall that\nthe gas constant is just R = KB ∗ NA. The units are determined by the prefactor A, which can be\nthought of as an average kinetic energy of the system.\nVacancies are always present in every solid because they're a result of thermally-activated pro\ncesses. We can consider the rate of formation of a vacancy and the rate of removal of that same\nvacancy as two thermally-activated processes, each with their own rate. At any given temperature,\nwhen the rate of forming the vacancy is the same as the rate of \"de-forming\" the vacancy then the\nvacancy concentration in the crystal will be in equilibrium. Since each rate is thermally activated\nwe can use an Arrhenius equation to describe both the forward and back process, and setting them\nequal for equilibrium one arrives at a formula describing how the vacancy concentration depends on\ntemperature:\n/kB T\nNv = Ne-Ea\nwhere Nv/N is the fractional concentration of vacancies and Ea is the activation energy [J] required\nto remove one atom. If the vacancy occurs in an ionic solid, charge\nneutrality must be maintained. Therefore, the defect either forms\nas a Schottky defect, where a pair of charges (one cation and one\nanion) is removed, or as a Frenkel defect, where the vacant atom sits\nFigure of Schottky defects\nvs. Frenkel defects removed\nelsewhere in the lattice on an interstitial site. For a Schottky defect\ndue to copyright restrictions.\nin an ionic solid like CaCl2, two anions (Cl-) must be removed for\neach cation (Ca+) vacancy to maintain charge neutrality. Frenkel\ndefects are most likely to occur in an ionic solid with a large anion\nand a smaller cation, like AgCl, AgBr, and AgI, for example.\nInterstitial defects can occur in covalent solids as well: in this case, an extra atom occupies a\nsite that is not part of the lattice, but the charge neutrality requirement doesn't necessitate the\ncreation of a vacancy provided the interstitial atoms have the same charge as the lattice atoms. For\nexample, a C interstitial in Fe is charge neutral. If the interstitial atom is the same type of atom as\nthe lattice, like a Si atom in a Si lattice but not on a lattice site, the defect is called a self-interstitial.\nThe energy required to form a self-interstitial (2-5eV) is much higher than for a vacancy (0.5-1eV),\nso these defects are much less common: this can be rationalized by thinking about how hard it would\nbe to squeeze an atom between similarly-sized atoms arranged in a closely-packed lattice.\n\nAtoms which take the place of another atom in a lattice are called substitutional defects. Gen\nerally, the Hume-Rothery rules provide guidelines to which atoms can be a substitutional defect:\nthe atomic size must be within +/- 15%, the crystal structure must be the same, the electronegativity\nmust be similar, and the valence must be the same or higher.\n\nWhy this matters\nLet's pick up on the interstitial defect of carbon in iron, otherwise known as steel. This particular\ndefect is one that has positive benefits if it's controlled carefully and the right amount of carbon (not\nmuch, it turns out) is placed in the right positions within the iron lattice (the tetrahedral holes, for\nexample, in bcc Fe).\nIn fact, the\nchange in iron's properties are ab\nsolutely tremendous and represent a\nspectacular example of how defects\ncan be used beneficially.\nIf you\nProduction vs. time figure removed due to\ntake a piece of pure iron and ap\ncopyright restrictions.\nply sideways strain on it, then its\nresolved shear stress is quite low,\naround 10 MPa.\nThat means that\nif you push sideways on a piece\nof pure iron it will deform under\n10 MPa of pressure.\nBut with\njust 1% C on interstial sites, the\nC-doped iron can have a resolved\nshear stress as high as 2000 MPa,\n200 times larger than the undoped\ncase!\nNow, this phenomenon has been\nknown and practiced for over 2500 years, when people first observed the mechanical strength im\nparted on iron when it was heated by a charcoal fire (the charcoal was the carbon source). But that's\njust it: 2500 years ago, or 1000 years ago, or even just 100 years ago, not a whole lot of steel was be\ning made each year. This is now changing, and it's changing dramatically, and it's Why This Matters.\nTake a look at the chart above (from US Geological Survey, UN, FAO, World Aluminium Asso\nciation) of the production amount for some of the materials humans make on a scale massive enough\nto require enormous chunks of the world's energy consumption. Cement and steel are the top two,\nand estimates put them at 10-15% combined of annual global CO2 emissions. If we look at just CO2\nemissions from industrial processes, steel has the biggest share\nat 25% of the total.But even more important are those slopes\nin the production trends:\nnote that the use of these prod-\nIndustrial carbon emissions\nucts is growing and will continue to grow dramatically into\nchart (right side) removed\nthe future.\nBack 2500 years ago it didn't matter how steel\ndue to copyright restrictions.\nwas made.\nThey also had no idea why the charcoal gave\niron those properties.\nToday, not only do we need to find\nnew ways to make steel more efficiently, but we also know\nwhat's happening in the material at the atomic and bonding\nscale.\nIn other words, we understand its solid state chem\nistry.\n\nHow can we make steel in a more energy efficient manner? Answering\nthat question relies on knowledge of the point defects in the material,\nand specifically on the energy it takes to get carbon into the intersti\ntial lattice. And it's not always obvious. For example, if we compare the atomic size of C with the\nsizes of the available interstitial volumes in Fe, it's clear that it doesn't quite fit, and some type of\nlattice distortion will have to take place in order to accommodate the interstitial defect, even as\nsmall as a C atom. But that means it's not as simple as occupying\nthe defect site with the most room, since we need to know how atoms\nPie chart illustrating the\nget strained in response to the defect being there. Take the example\nhardest emissions to\nof -iron: in that phase you would think a C atom occupies the larger\neliminate removed due to\ntetrahedral hole, but in fact it prefers to go to the octahedral intersti\ncopyright restrictions.\ntial site. The reason for this preference is that when the C-atom goes\ninto the interstitial, strain gets relieved for the octahedral site by two\nnearest neighbor iron atoms moving a little bit, while for tetrahedral\nsite, four iron atoms are nearest-neighbor and the displacement of all\nof these requires more strain energy. This is just one phase of iron and\ntwo different sites. There may be ways to move C atoms into other\nphases more easily, that would take less energy, and give the same\nstrength. Or perhaps there are other ways beyond fire (which is why\nsteel-making takes so much energy) to get the defect chemistry just\nright. This is a hard problem, but it's a critical one: take a look at\nthis chart from a recent paper published in Science that breaks down\nwhich sectors will be hardest to make \"green.\" Note the prominence\nof steel and cement! To solve such hard problems, we will need advances in defect chemistry.\nWhy this employs\nThis is an easy one: there's actually a job position called \"Defect Engineer\"! At Global Foundries,\nthey care about defects for the basic manufacture of semiconductor materials while at Intel, there are\nopenings for Defect Engineers to work on 3D XPoint which is a new non-volatile memory technol\nogy. Intel also has an opening for a \"Defect Reduction Engineer.\" These and so many more similar\nopenings are for industries where devices are made in clean rooms, often very clean cleanrooms. A\n\"Class 1\" cleanroom, for example, means that if you take a meter cubed of air at any given place in\nthe room, you would count less than 10 particles of size 100 nanometers, less than 2 particles size\nless than 200 nanometers, and zero particles larger than that. The reason fabrication facilities need\nsuch a high level of air purity is that they're making features on the order of 10's of nanometers and\nso any small defect can be a big problem.\nNow, then again, these are not necessarily point defects (although certainly 100 nm particles that hit\na layer of silicon while its being processed can cause point defects). How about technologies where\nthe point defect is the key part of the technology itself? In that case you may be talking about a\nsolid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). These are typically metal-oxides and they work by conducting oxygen\nions through the material. But the only way an oxygen ion can move is if there are oxygen vacancies\n\npresent, and in enough density at reasonable temperatures. Many companies work on developing\nefficient, low-cost, and low temperature solid oxide fuel cells. Every single car manufacturer for\nexample, has an interest in this as a possible future way to power transportation (Nissan has a\ncool demo car). Other companies like Precision Combustion, Elcogen, or Bloom Energy all work to\nbuild SOFCs, with that last one stating, \"better electrons\" *on their homepage. Nice. (although\nI thought all electrons were identical. . . but anyway). The point is that there's a growing interest\nin SOFC and an already strong market set to reach $1B by 2024. With greater control over those\noxygen vacancies, the ability to make the materials cheaper, and the ability to control defects at\nlower temperatures, the use of SOFC could increase even much more than that!\nExtra practice\n1.

Solid oxide fuel cells rely on the reaction of fuel with oxygen to form water. A ceramic oxide can\nbe doped to introduce oxygen vacancies that allow charge to conduct through the solid electrolyte.\nZirconia (ZrO2) can be doped by adding Sc2O3. If 0.5g of Sc2O3 can be incorporated into 10g of\nZrO2 while maintaining the zirconia structure, how many oxygen vacancies are generated?\n\nSolutions\n1.\n2. We are doping ZrO2 with SC2O3. The Zr4+ ions are replaced by the Sc3+ ions, creating a\ncharge imbalance of -1 with each substitution. This means that for every 2 such replacements, or\nevery 2 Sc3+ ions added, there will be a -2 imbalance, and an oxygen vacancy (V 00) will be created\nO\nto compensate and achieve charge neutrality.\n1molSc2O3\n0.5gSc2O3(\n) = 0.0036molSc2\n137.9g\n0.0072 mol Sc3+ added = 0.0036 mol VO \"\nTotal number of oxygen vacancies = 2.18 × 1021\n\nLecture 24: Line Defects and Stress-Strain Curves\nSummary\nLine defects are 1-dimensional defects in a crystal that affect many macroscopic materials properties,\nincluding deformation. In 3.091, we'll focus on two types of de\nformation: elastic deformation, which is reversible (strain only\noccurs when there is a stress applied, and it goes back once\nthe stress is removed), and plastic deformation, which is perma\nnent.\nElastic deformation can be likened to connecting all of the atoms\nwith springs: Hooke's law, F=-kx, tells us that there is a restoring\nforce that returns the material to its initial state. This corresponds\nto the initial linear region in a stress-strain curve. If a material\nis brittle, it will likely break in the linear regime. However, if the\nmaterial is ductile, it can undergo plastic deformation: the material\nno longer responds linearly to the applied stress. One deformation\nmechanism that occurs during plastic deformation is called slip: individual planes of atoms slide\npast\neach other due to the presence of a line defect.\nA dislo\ncation is a type of line defect that forms when atoms are\nslightly misaligned: an extra plane of atoms exists in the crys\ntal.\nDislocations can move through a crystal when a force is applied.\nAtoms slip over another to relieve the internal stress caused by apply\ning a force. How can we tell what the slip planes are? In order for\nthe material to slip, two adjacent planes of atoms must slide past each\nother. As this happens, the bonds between the planes must break and\nre-form. Therefore, slip planes must be planes that have the lowest\ninter-planar bond density. You can verify that this means that the\nmost densely packed planes will be slip planes, because they have the\nhighest intra-planar bond density. This means that slip occurs par\nallel to the closely packed planes: together, the slip planes and slip\ndirection form a crystal's slip system. Many materials can undergo\ndislocation-mediated slip, but metals in particular are known for this mechanism of deformation.\nThe sea of electrons we learned about in metals allow bonds to move around (break and re-form in\na new spot) with ease compared to ionic and covalent solids, which have much more rigid electronic\nstructures.\nWhen stress is first applied to an elastic material, dislocations form initially as planes of atoms\npull apart. If two dislocations run into each other as they're moving around, the defects can become\npinned, so they can no longer move through the crystal. As more and more dislocations are pinned,\nthey become tangled and slip doesn't occur: the material would continue to deform elastically but\nStress-strain plot (upper right) (c) source unknown.

In other words, dislocation pinning makes materials\nDislocation motion figure (pg. 6) removed due to copyright restrictions.\nharder. This mechanism of material strengthening is called work hardening. Work hardening causes\nthe yield strength to increase, but at the expense of ductility.\nWhy this matters\nLet's talk about wind energy. Wind has the same intermittency challenges that solar has (so in other\nwords it can only really be useful on a large scale if we can store the energy cheaply and efficiently).\nBut wind also has many advantages and is a very appealing way to generate electricity. That's why\nthe installed wind capacity has seen tremendous growth globally over the last 20 years. In the U.S.,\nmore than 5% of our total electricity is now generated by the wind.\nA wind turbine is actually based on fairly simple technology, which is one of the reasons it's so\nappealing. Basically, the wind turns the blades, which provides the force to run an electric motor\nin reverse to generate electricity. The\nchallenge is that the most consis\ntent, high energy winds occur at\nhigh altitudes, so the blades are\nmore efficient the larger and higher\nup one can make them go.\nThis\nmeans that the blades have to sup\nport tremendous mechanical loads\nGlobal Cumulative Installed Wind Capacity\n2001-2016 (pg. 3) chart removed due to\ncopyright restrictions.\nfrom the high wind power.\nAnd\nto make matters more difficult, the\nblades have to be able to go back\nand forth between high, low or\nno wind depending on the time of\nday.\n(as an aside, I love to look\nat maps and if you're interested in\nseeing how the wind speed varies\naround the globe, there are a lot\nof cool maps that show this to\nyou).\n\nSo in other words, we need blades that are strong enough that they don't break apart under the\nextreme stress of the wind force, but flexible enough that they can bend without irreversible defor\nmation. And what is it that we need to understand and engineer in order to make better blades?\nThe line defects of course!!\nTake a look at this plot of materials.\nHere we're looking at the density of the ma\nterial on the x-axis and the Young's modu\nlus on the y-axis.\nThe Young's modulus is\nsimply a measure of the elastic stiffness of\nthe material,\nso if we go back up to our\nstress/strain curve at the beginning of this chap\nter, it's related to the slope of the linear elas\ntic regime.\nFor a wind turbine blade, we'd\nlike it to be lightweight and strong, but also\nflexible.\nAs we learned in this lecture, the\nline defects are related to the plasticity, which\nis related to the yield stress,\nwhich is re\nlated to how much a material can be elastically\nstrained.\nFrom the chart, we can compare the different classes\nof materials (like metals vs. ceramics vs. polymers,\netc) for two of these properties: density and stiffness.\nWhat's interesting about this is that there are enor\nmous parts of the chart that are currently empty. In other words, there's a lot of work to be done\nto find and prepare materials that are both heavy and flexible, or light and strong. And you know\nwhat this means: new chemistry combined with control over line defects!\nWhy this employs\nLet's go big. This boat, for example, is called the SS Schenectady, and it has a bit of a problem.\nMostly that it's cracked in half. A lot of ships built during World War II were made from low-\ngrade steel, which was too easy to fracture at the temperatures of the sea. In fact, they did test\nthe strength of their steel but only in the dry dock, so the test\ntemperature was higher than the operational temperature. Once\nthe ship was in the colder water, the steel became much more brit\ntle and it became much easier for defects to form, and once they\nformed it was easy for them to grow under applied stress. One\ncertainly doesn't want plastic deformation of a ship's metal, but\none does not want this type of brittleness either. Getting the right\nstrength for the right application under the right conditions requires\na lot of knowledge of the materials and their defect properties. And\nAshby plot (c) source unknown.

Think about it: pretty\nmuch everything we build today has to have some sort of operating\nconditions where the mechanical properties can be counted on to work as expected. Otherwise, ships\ncrack in half, bridges collapse, and roads buckle.\nSince I just gave the example of the ship, how about this one: the U.S. Department of the Navy\nhas an opening for a \"Materials Engineer\" where they explicitly ask for experience in, \"strength\nof materials (stress-strain relationships).\" Corning's Manufacturing, Technology and Engineering\ndivision is hiring a \"Scientist/Engineer\" to do modeling of the strength of materials, presumably\nmostly glasses. There's an opening for a \"Research Engineer - Materials Behavior,\" at GE to design\nmechanical properties of new structural materials and coatings being for aircraft propulsion. There\nare so many jobs in this space I couldn't possibly even categorize them all: pretty much any com\npany that makes or deals with materials has jobs available related to their mechanical strength and\nfailure. From ships, to buildings, medical devices to clothing, spacecraft to furniture, defects hold\nthe key.\n\nExtra practice\n1.

When they don't\narrange in an ordered fashion, silica glass is formed. Whether the solid that forms is crystalline or\nglassy depends strongly on the processing conditions the silica un\ndergoes.\nOne metric to quantify the processing conditions is by looking at\nhow the molar volume changes as a function of temperature. For\na crystal, the plot looks like this. There's a sloped line that corre\nsponds to the solid material, then a jump, then a different sloped\nline that corresponds to the liquid phase. The jump occurs at the\nmelting temperature Tm: when the material melts or freezes, it un\ndergoes a huge change in volume. The slope of each line is defined\nas the coefficient of thermal expansion. However, sometimes when\na material is cooled, it can remain in the liquid phase below Tm:\nthis is called supercooling. When a liquid is supercooled, continues to act like a liquid until one of\ntwo things happens:\n1. It crystallizes, characterized by a big jump\ndown to the crystalline solid line and then solid\nbehavior\n2. It suddenly becomes a solid, \"freezing\" in its\ndisordered state and becoming a glass. This\ntransition is characterized by a change in slope\nat Tg, the point at whih solid forms (called the\nglass transition temperature), but no disconti\nnuity in the freezing curve.\nHow can we know which path a material will take? It\ndepends on materials properties: if the liquid has a\nhigh mobility (low viscosity), the molecules can move\nMolecular structure of SiO4 (upper right) removed due to copyright restrictions.

Highly viscous or\nlow mobility liquids are much more likely to get stuck in a glass. Further, if the crystalline structure\nis very complicated, or if the liquid is cooled very quickly, it's hard for the atoms to find crystalline\nsites before the solid forms: these cases are also more likely to lead to glass formation.\nThe volume per mole is a good measure of the disorder in the material: the further the molar\nvolume is from the crystalline case, the more glassy the material is. Although a material only has\none melting point, it can have multiple glass transitions depending on how it is processed. XRD is\none tool that can be used to determine whether a material is a crystal or a glass: as the material gets\nmore and more disordered, the sharp peaks observed in the XRD pattern disappear into a broad\namorphous halo.\nWhy This Matters\nSiO2 glass is made from sand and there's a whole lot of it on the planet. SiO2 stands out as a base\nmaterial that has really awesome properties. That's partly because of its tremendous abundance.\nCheck out this plot of the abundance of atoms in the earth's crust. Note that of all of the elements\nin the periodic table, oxygen and silicon are #1 and #2. This means that silica is cheap, and we're\nnot going to run out, unlike other elements. In fact, there are many \"critial elements\" like Li Co,\nGa, Te, and Nd to name a few, labeled as such by the Department of Energy because there is conern\nthat there will not be enough of them in the future to meet global demand. But Si and O are the\nopposite of critical: they are dramatically abundant. And this presents tremendous opportunity to\nuse SiO2 as a base material for wide-ranging applications.\nAnd this is why the chemistry that we learned in this lecture matters: because we learned that\n\nthe key properties of glass, and the way that it's processed, all come\nfrom the chemistry. The ways in which we continue to use glass\non this planet can increase as human population and technological\nneeds/use continue to increase, but how can we do utilize glass more\nPhoto of Marcus Kayser's Solar Sinter\nsustainably given that the base material is so abundant? Or what\nremoved due to copyright restrictions.\nother applications can glass be useful where it's currently not used\ntoday? Can glass be made \"greener\"? One cool example for how\nthis could work is in the work of Markus Keyser, who invented the\n\"Solar Sinter.\" This is a self-sufficient 3D printer of glass objects\nthat you can drive out into the dessert, feed the sand and sunlight\nthat are both plentiful, and print glass objects. The sunlight is used\nboth to power the electric motor of the printer but also the create\nenough thermal energy to get above Tg for the sand. You can now\nbuy commercial 3D glass printers, but I like this example because it's emission-neutral.\nThe future of how far we push technologies like this will depend on how far we're able to push\nthe properties of glass. In the next lecture we're going to discuss a few different ways to control\nglass properties, but you only need today's lecture and an understanding of those silicate groups to\nunderstand the key link between chemistry and why this matters.\nWhy this employs\nCorning is one of the biggest and most well-known glass makers in the world. That video I men\ntioned in the lecture above that I showed in class, about Prince Rupert's Drop, that was from the\nAbundance vs. Atomic number diagram is in the public domain (source: Wikimedia Commons).\n\n\"Corning Museum of Glass\" educational series. They are really, really into glass. And they're big:\ntheir 2018 revenue was $11.4B and they've got 51,500 employees currently. On their website if you\nclick on the \"engineering\" section of the job openings page you'll find hundreds listings. They've\nalso got a ton of internships for students:, \"A Corning internship offers valuable hands-on experience\nfor individuals in their chosen discipline to include but not limited to Material Science, Engineering,\nResearch, Manufacturing, IT, HR, Marketing, Finance and Supply Chain.\" It's a cool place that has\nmade it big out of glass and made glass into a big deal.\nCorning works on a wide range of applications of glass, but let's focus on just one of them: fiber\noptic cables. Most of the backbone of today's internet is served by fiber optics, which are made of\nsilica glass, because they have so many advantages over (older) copper wiring. For example, fiber\noptic cables can carry much higher bandwidth over longer distances than copper, this means the\nneed for signal boosters is lessened, and fiber optic cables are also less susceptible to interference\nfrom external electromagnetic fields so they don't need shielding, and finally they don't break down\nor corrode nearly as often so they're much less expensive to maintain. It's no wonder that major U.S.\ncompanies like Comcast FiOS and Google Fiber are working to get fiber optic cables beyond being\njust the internet backbone, but into literally every single building in the country. Unlike Corning\nwhich many of us may have heard of already, some of the top fiber optics companies are less known\neven while being huge companies (meaning: lots of jobs!). Take OFS Optics, which makes fiber op\ntics cables for over 50 different application spaces. They have over $250M in annual revenues, and in\none of their job postings for an \"RD Engineer\" states that they are looking for someone to, \"lead the\ndevelopment of manufacturing processes for the next generation of glass optical fiber products.\" Cool.\nOr how about going international to companies like Prysmian (based in Italy), which has over\n$1B in annual revenue, has a \"Graduate Program\" for recent grads to immerse them quickly with a\nmentorship program and also has the coolest name for a fiber with their \"BendBright\" brand. Or\nthere's YOFC based in China with over $1B/year in revenue, and nice slogan, \"Smart Link Better\nLife,\" or Fujikura with $7B annual sales and a claim to be, \"Shaping the Future with Tsunagu Tech\nnology.\" (that means \"connecting\"). These and so many more companies are working on making\nnext-generation fiber-optic cables, and if you dig a few layers deep into any of them, you'll see how\ncomplicated the production of fiber optic cables is, how many different ways it can be done today\nand will be done in the future, and how many jobs there are that directly relate to knowledge of\nSiO2 glass!\nIt's not just all about processing: there is fundamental chemistry research to be done on silica\nglass, too. By doping silica glass with other elements, its properties can be changed. For example,\nby adding Erbium ions, the glass transforms from a passive light carrier to an amplifier capable of\nmaking the signal several orders of magnitude higher. And if you're interested in coding, there's a\nlot of work to be done to simulate how light travels in media like glass, and how it interacts with\nthese dopants.\n\nExtra practice\n1.

It can mean adding impurities that change properties like\nthe glass transition temperature (Tg), the solubility, the durability, etc. What unites most of these\nglass modifiers is that they are oxide donors, meaning they give up an O2- ion. This implies that\nthese modifiers have stable cations, so often metals are good. For example:\nCaO → Ca2+ + O2-\nNa2O → 2Na+ + O2-\nAl2O3 → 2Al3+ + 3O2-\nThe donated O2- ion attacks the Si-O-Si bond and breaks it into two. It's like a knife that cuts the\nglass bond, and so this process is called chain scission. The O2- is able to insert itself into the\nbond and with its two extra electrons satisfies the charge state of the oxygen atoms that now \"cap\"\nthe chains on each end. So we have that Si-O-Si + O2- → Si-O | O-Si with negative charge on\neach O. As shown in the figure, the Na+ ions hang around the oxygen. The effect of chain scission\nNon-bridging oxygen formation in silicate glasses figure removed due to copyright restrictions.\non the properties of glasses is enormous. Just take the melting temperature as an example: for\ncrystalline SiO2 (quartz) the Tm is greater than 1200°C. For soda-lime glass, the glass transition\ntemperature is typically around 500°C. If the silicate chains are cut, then the material is much less\nviscous, and it can find better packing more easily, leading to lower volume per mole and also a\nlower glass transition temperature (more supercooling).\nThe base chemistry of the solid, which in the case described above is SiO2, is the network former.\nThe oxide donor is called the network modifier. Adding net\nwork modifiers is another way to change a glass cooling curve.\nFor example, curve (b) to the right could be obtained using SiO2\nwith 5% PbO and curve (a) using SiO2 with 10% PbO. The rea\nson is that more cutting of the chains makes the material less vis\ncous, which means it can find better packing and be supercooled\nmore.\nWe discussed two ways that mechanical properties are engineered\nin glass. First, the glass can be tempered: molten glass is cooled\ndown with air and if the outside of the glass solidifies while the inside is still a liquid, then the\noutside has a completely different volume per mole than the inside. the hot melted SiO2 solidifies\nbut since it cannot have the smaller volume that it would like to have, it puts a inward pressure\nComparison of Tg (c) source unknown.

The second method of glass strengthening\nis called ion exchange. It involves swapping ions left in glass by network modifiers with ions of\ndifferent size, which creates compressive stress.\nWhy this matters\nThe ability to engineer glass with wide-ranging properties has led to its use in a whole lot more than\nwindows. How about: doors, fa cades, plates, cups, bowls, insulation, food storage, bottles, solar\npanels, wind turbines, mirrors, balustrades, tables, partitions, cook tops, ovens, televisions, comput\ners, phones, aircraft, ships, windscreens, backlights, medical technology, optical glass, biotechnology,\nfiber optic cables, radiation barriers. And on top of that, glass is almost fully recyclable. The main\nreason glass has become so ubiquitous in all of these different ways is beause of its massive chemical\ntunability as discussed in this lecture.\nBut here I want to focus on one particular property: strength. We talked today about using\ncompressive stress to make glass stronger. But what if glass could be made stronger still? What if\nit could be made stronger than major structural materials\nlike steel? In research labs, that is exactly what is hap\npening. For example, in a Nature Materials paper from\n2011 (doi:10.1038/nmat2930), the authors made a certain\ntype of metallic glass stronger than steel and critically\nalso tougher than steel. That means that not only does it\nFracture toughness vs yield strength\nremoved due to copyright restrictions.\nhave a high Young's modulus, but when it breaks it can\ndeform plastically as opposed to shattering. They created\nthis new material through its chemistry, by adding a touch\nof palladium and a dash of silver to the mix. It already\nhad a bit of phosphorus, silicon, and germanium, but by\nadding the palladium and silver, the glass was able to sur\npass steel in both hardness and toughness. Since then,\nmany more demonstrations of mechanically super-strong\nglass have been made (often trying to avoid Palladium\nwhich costs $50,000 per kg. Here's a plot from that same\npaper, showing the fracture toughness vs. the yield strength of different materials. Again, the yield\nis related to how much force the material can withstand without breaking, and the toughness is\nhow much it can break without shattering. Going up on both axes can be very appealing for many\napplications. I love plots like this (called \"Ashby plots\") since we can right away compare a bunch of\ndifferent materials, in this case oxides, ceramics, polymers, metals, and of course their own new stuff\n(shown as \"x\" marks on the plot). Note how strong regular old oxide glasses are but also how little\ntoughness they have (when they give, they shatter). But notice also how much tougher they can get\nby engineering their chemistry. This could put amorphous materials on a trajectory to becoming\nsome of the most if not the most damage tolerant materials in the world!\n\nWhy this employs\nIn the last lecture for this section I listed glass manufacturing and companies working on innovating\nin glass chemistry. For this chapter on engineered glass, let's talk about smarts. In particular,\n\"smart glass.\" For now, that label means one specific type of silicate-based glass: switchable glass.\nIt has been around for a long time, as even in the 1980's you may have noticed (ok, your parents may\nhave noticed) people wearing the sunglasses that automatically tinted and de-tinted in response to\nthe sun (that used what are called \"thermochromic\" materials embedded in the glass, which change\ncolor based on temperature. They never worked all that well, staying a little too shaded inside\nand a little too unshaded outside, but the idea was there. But now we've gone from thermo- to\nelectro-chromic glass, and the possibilities are seriously exciting. With a tiny applied voltage, glass\ncan be engineered to go back and forth between near full transparency and near full-opacity. Apart\nfrom being extremely cool, this type of technology can have a lot of positive sustainability-related\nbenefits, since the glass can be programmed to automatically dim and brighten in response to out\ndoor light conditions -- that can in turn dramatically reduce a building's energy needs.\nThis type of smart glass is still on the early side although a number of companies are taking off,\nand that means jobs. These will be jobs at either mid or early-range start-ups, but in some cases\nthey've closed mega (>$100M) fund-raising rounds so definitely growth is strong. Some companies\nin this space include Kinestral, Smartglass, View, Suntuitive, Gentex, Intelligent Glass, or Glass\nApps. A lot of the investment in these companies is coming from the bigger ones like Asahi Glass\nor Corning, which have of course also started their own smart glass programs. Taken together all\nof this spells jobs in the future of glass. And its future looks very bright, far beyond switching the\ncolor or transparency, as the thermal, electronic and optical properties of the material continue to\nbe engineered. We may or may not be living in the \"Age of Glass,\" as Corning likes to say, but we\nsure are living in an exciting time for this material.\nExample Problems\n1.

Some terms to know: concentration = moles / liter\n= molarity = [ ], rate = d [ ] / dt, a rate law is some equation that relates the rate to [ ], an\nintegrated rate law relates the [ ] to t(ime), and the Arrhenius equation gives us the rate vs.\nT(emperature).\nTake a simple reaction where aA → bB: since mass is conserved, A disappears no faster than\nB appears, so the actual reaction rate is = 1/b d[B] / dt = - 1/a d[A] / dt. In other words,\nthe change in the concentration of B must equal the opposite of the change in concentration of A\nweighted by one over the molar coefficient a or b. We can have more than one reactant product and\nthe same idea holds. For example, suppose we have 2 of each: aA + bB → cC + dD. In this case\nthe reaction rate would be:\n-1 d[A]\n-1 d[B]\n1 d[C]\n1 d[D]\nrate =\n=\n=\n=\na\ndt\nb\ndt\nc dt\nd dt\nThe general way to write an equation for the rate for the equation above is: rate = k[A]m[B]n , where\nk=rate constant and is dependent on\nconditions (T, P, solvent), m and\nn are exponents determined experi\nmentally, m+n is called the reac\ntion order.\nNote that the rate\nunits must always be M/s by defi\nnition, so this means that units of\nk depend on n and m.\nFor this\nclass we'll cover three different or\n0th\n1st\nders of reactions:\n,\n, and\n2nd .\nTo know the order of a reaction based on data tables like the one below, take any two rows of\ndata: say the t=26 min and t=70 min rows. The concentration ratio between these two times is\n0.0020/0.0034 = 0.5882. The rate ratio is 1.8/5.0 = 0.36\n\nFirst of all the rate is changing so it can't be 0th or\nder.\nSecond of all, at two different times the ra\ntio of concentrations is not equal to the ratio of rates,\nso it can't be 1st order.\nBut if we square the ra\ntio of concentrations,\n(0.0020/0.0034)2\n=\n0.35 which\nis very close to 0.36, so now we have our answer:\nfrom the data we can say the reaction is 2nd or\nder!\nTo know the role of temperature in determining reaction rates, we must first learn about colli\nsion theory. Collision theory frames the reaction between molecules, say A and B, as follows: 1) a\nreaction can only occur when A and B collide, 2) not all collisions result in the formation of product,\n3) there are two factors that matter most: the energy of the collision, and the orientation of molecule\nA with respect to B at the time of collision.\nWe can think of the energy required for A to react with B to be a kind of \"activation energy\"\nor Ea. As we learned in chapter 14 (phases), molecules at a given temperature have a distribution\nof kinetic energies with that temperature being the aver\nage.\nThat means some molecules have much more en\nergy than the average, while other have less.\nReac\ntions are similar in that it's the part of the distribution\nhigher than the activation energy that matters. This plot\nshows how this works: the distribution of energies for a\ngiven molecule at two different temperatures shows that\nfor higher temperature more molecules will have energies\nabove the activation energy than for the lower tempera\nture.\nThe Arrhenius equation gives us an expression that summa\nrizes the collision model of chemical kinetics. It goes as follows:\nrate = (collision frequency)*(a steric factor)*(the fraction of\ncollisions with E > Ea). In math terms, that's shown\nhere for the equation for rate (k).\nA = the frequency factor, and its units depend on the\nreaction order. For example if the reaction is first order\nthen the frequency factor must have units of s-1 The ac\ntivation energy, Ea, we've already discussed. If it's given\nin units per mole, like J/mol, we use R as it's written,\nwhere R is the ideal gas constant R = 8.314 J/K*mol.\nIf the activation energy is given in units of eV, then the\nconstant used would be the Boltzmann constant in units\nof eV (8.61733×10-5 eV/K).\nThis relationship means that if we plot the natural log\nChart of time/concentration (upper left) and reaction coordinate (lower left) by B.A. Averill and P.\nEldridge in General Chemistry.

The last example of a way to change the\nrate of a reaction that we'll mention (and unlike those other two, we'll really just mention it and\nnot go into detail) is the catalyst. A catalyst is a way to increase the rate of a reaction without\nhaving anything consumed as part of it. It's a material that, in the language of our discussion on\nArrhenius above, lowers the activation energy for the reaction.\nWhy this matters\nLet's keep going with the catalyst theme for this section. It is estimated that ≈90% of all commer\ncially produced chemical products involve catalysts at some stage in the process of their manufac\nture! Some of these processes I've already highlighted in other Why This Matters moments, like the\nHaber-Bosch process for fixing N2, or the depletion of O3 by CFCs. At the time, we hadn't learned\nabout reaction rates or catalysts, so I didn't go into it. But in both cases the role of the catalyst\nis absolutely essential (in fact, the big innovation of Haber-Bosch was not to discover the reaction\n(which had been known) but rather to discover a catalyst that lowers the temperature needed to\nmake the reaction happen economically and at large scales.\nLet's discuss another world-changing catalytically enhanced reaction: namely, the removal of most\ntoxic emissions from cars and trucks. I know, you may be thinking that the tailpipe of a car smells\npretty toxic. And that's because it is, but it's a whole lot better than it used to be, and the reason is\nthe catalysts that are now part of every tailpipe in the form of what is called the catalytic converter.\nWhy did we need these in the first place? It all goes back to the very first reaction we wrote on the\nfirst day of lecture: combustion. One example I gave was the combustion of methane:\nCH4 + 2O2 → 2H2O + CO2\nIt's true that CO2 is harmful to the environment for reasons of climate change, but there's nothing\ntoxic in those products... so what's the problem?\nAh, if only cars burned pure methane! But gasoline is far, far away from a pure fuel source.\nAnd furthermore, even modern car engines are far, far\naway from being able to burn the fuel perfectly without\nside-reactions. Gasoline is a mixture of about 150 different\nchemicals, and these include not just those hydrocarbons\nthat combust, but also a host of additives that range in\npurpose from corrosion inhibitors to lubricants to oxygen\nboosters. Since this complex chemical soup doesn't burn\ncleanly, we get both direct products and by-products that\ngo far beyond the pure case of H2O and CO2. Many of\nthese products are pollutants and some are really bad ones. An incomplete list would include: car\nbon monoxide (CO) which is poisonous, nitrogen oxides (like NO and NO2, or \"NOX\" as they're\ncalled) which cause smog and have many adverse health effects, sulfur oxides (yes, you guessed it,\nSmog photos (c) sources unknown. All rights reserved. This content is excluded from our Creative\nCommons license. For information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/fairuse.\n\n\"SOX\") which cause acid rain, and unburned hydrocarbons or volatile organic compounds (VOCs)\nwhich cause cancer.\nSimilar to the removal of CFC's from refrigerants, cleaning up the tailpipe represents a fantas\ntic example for how policy and regulation can make the world better. It was the Clean Air Act\nthat Congress passed in 1970 that gave the newly-formed EPA the legal authority to regulate this\ntoxic mess that came out of cars. As a result, today's cars are ≈99% fewer emissions compared\nto the 1960s! The fuels are also cleaner (lead was removed and sulfur levels lowered), and taken\ntogether cities have much healthier air. Take a look at this picture of New York city from 1973 (left)\ncompared to 2013 (right). In the 1970's, smog from car exhaust overwhelmed most major U.S. cities.\nThe key technology that enabled this dramatic clean-up is the catalytic converter. Inside a cat\nalytic converter there are actually multiple catalysts, each enhancing different reactions. Most cars\ntoday use what is called a \"three-way\" catalyst, which just means that it tackles all three of the\nbiggest pollutants: NOX, hydrocarbons, and CO. The key materials used as the catalysts are a\ncombination of platinum, palladium, and rhodium. Inside a catalytic convertor one typically has\na honeycomb mesh just to get a large surface area. Since the temperature gets quite high (and in\nfact needs to be high for the catalysts to operate, which is why cold engines pollute more than hot\nones), the honeycomb mesh is made out of a ceramic material like alumina so it can handle T=500°C\nwithout cracking or degradation. The Pt, Pd, and Rh metals coat the Al2O3 mesh, and the exhaust\nflows through.\nTake a look at this catalytic converter schematic. You can see two different chambers, one where\nthe metal acts as a \"reduction catalyst\" for the NOX re\nmoval and the other where a different metal (or combi\nnation of metals) acts as an \"oxidation catalyst\" to treat\nCO and unburned hydrocarbons. In the reduction cat\nalyst chamber, the reaction we're trying to accelerate is\n2NO → N2 + O2. In order to do so, the catalyst binds\nthe NO molecule to it, and is then able to pull off the ni\ntrogen atom from NO and hold it in place. Then another\nN atom that also got pulled off of a different NO molecule\ngets stuck to the catalyst somewhere nearby, and those\ntwo N atoms are able to find each other and make N2.\nLikewise, the oxygen can form O)2. The whole point is\nthat the catalyst finds a different way to carry out the\nsame reaction with much lower barriers. The oxidation catalyst burns CO and hydrocarbons using\nremaining O2 gas, for example to get this reaction to go: 2CO + O2 → 2CO2. Again, that reaction\nwould not occur at a high rate normally, but the catalyst breaks it down into steps (like splitting\nCO) that occur much more easily.\nCatalytic converter (c) source unknown.

We could\nbe talking about any sort of chemical synthesis job, or in drug design where reaction rate is crucial\nto the drug's effectiveness and safety, or how about food making (even beyond beer) where rates\ndetermine anything from how long to let dough rise to how fast that dough browns in an oven vs.\nthe apples inside turning mushy (I just made an apple pie in case you couldn't tell), to how quickly\nto food goes bad. The point is that making stuff is inherently about rates.\nAnd so instead of focusing on any one of these things that we make, I'd like to use this Why\nThis Employs section to mention the fact that in nearly everything we make today, far too much\nnatural capital is expended, and it doesn't have to be that way. A single computer chip takes\nmore than 600 times as much mass to make it and tremendous amounts of both water and energy\n(including annealing multiple times at temperatures over 1000°C. Cement is a wonderful material\n(\"liquid stone\") but it takes baking calcium silicate at very high temperatures to make the tiny\nparticles called \"clinkers\" that give it the ability to take on any shape in an instant and then dry\nand set so quickly after. Why is it that, time and time again, we fail to do what nature does so\nwell? Animals can build incredibly strong and complex structures without going a single degree\nover room temperature. Spiders spin silk stronger than steel without lighting a fire. How can we do\nbetter? Much of it comes down to reaction rates. We use these massive amounts of energy and high\ntemperatures and harsh chemicals because we want to make stuff quickly and because we need to\nmake stuff in almost unimaginable quantities. China alone produced 2.5 trillion kilograms of cement\nlast year!\nThere are more sustainable ways to make stuff, especially if we can get a handle on the reac\ntion rates. Ten years ago I remember reading articles about the new revolution of \"green chemistry\"\n(check out for example this 2010 article in Scientific American, https://www.scientificamerican.\ncom/article/green-chemistry-benign-by-design/. I remember thinking then that this field was\nready to take off. Well, it didn't really happen with a bang, but slow and steady this idea of benign\ndesign is taking hold. If you search for green chemistry jobs, you'll find many companies now invest\ning in this area substantially and that spells new jobs. The idea of green chemistry on the job market\nranges quite broadly, from finding ways to synthesize materials without toxic chemicals, to making\nthe drug discovery process biodegradable, to lowering the temperatures needed in a manufacturing\nstep. Whatever it is, it's all about the rates.\n\nExample problems\n1. Acetic acid is made from carbon monoxide and methanol according to the following equation:\nCO(g) + MeOH(g) → AcOH(g)\nYour company wants to know how to improve this reaction: they present you, a chemical consultant,\nwith the following data. Propose a rate law for the reaction.\nCO pressure\nMeOH pressure\nAcetic acid formed\n21.5 atm\n15.0 atm\n980 mol/hour\n11.1 atm\n15.0 atm\n499 mol/hour\n11.1 atm\n10.0 atm\n502 mol/hour\n\nSolutions\n1. The rate is fairly insensitive to changing MeOH, but the rate drops by about half when the\npressure of CO is halved. Therefore, the rate is 0th order in methanol, but 1st order in CO:\nrate = k[CO]\n\nLecture 28: Equilibium and Solubility\nSummary\nMany of you have probably heard the expression, \"like dissolves like\". . . but let's add a little bit\nmore chemistry to that phrase. What is really meant by the word \"like\" is \"similar bonds,\" so\nthe expression could also be said, \"similar bonds dissolve similar bonds.\" Solubility is a metric\nthat tells us how much the solute (the solid being dissolved) can break apart and dissolve into the\nsolvent (the liquid in which the solid is dissolving). When the solubility is miscible that means\nthat it can be full mixed together at any concentration.\nIntermolecular forces play a huge role in solubility. Water is called a polar solvent (also called\nhydrophilic) because it's a solvent with large dipole moments, while hydrocarbons are examples of\nnonpolar solvents (also called hydrophobic) since the dominant IMF is London. Polar solvents\nare in general immiscible with nonpolar solvents.\nWhat's really going on at the scale of the molecule and its various IMFs, is that if a molecule\ncan lower or keep similar its energy by welcoming a different molecule into its bonding environment,\nthen it will do so. If on the other hand the other molecule cannot bond in the same way (as in the\nexample of the longer hydrocarbon chaining having much more London forces than H-bond ability)\nthen it would raise the energy of the system for the solvent to bond to it over itself.\nParticles in a solution that re-join the solid are said to be precipitating. both dissolution and\nprecipitation occur simultaneously and at the point of saturation, or maximum solubility, they hap\npen at exactly the same rate. This is called dynamic equilibrium.\nWe know from our previous lectures on ionic solids that these are cations and anions in the solid,\nwhich is the basis of the ionic bond. When dissolved in water, they also remain ions, just now in\nsolution, where they interact strongly with water. We can understand why, since we know from our\nIMF lecture that the ions will interact with the dipole of the water molecule. The reason there is\na trend in the solubility of these salts is related to the strength of the bond between ions in the\nsolid relative to those the liquid. As the ionic bonding becomes stronger (from weakest at NaI to\nstrongest at NaF), less of it dissolves.\nSuppose the general reaction has already reached its dynamic equilibrium:\naA + bB ↔ cC + dD\nThis means that the four different concentrations, [A], [B], [C], and [D] are not changing even though\nthe reaction is still going in both directions. Below is a nice picture of what might happen to these\nconcentrations as a function of time. At first during the reaction the concentrations change, and\nthen they all flatten out. At that point, when they're all flat, the system has reached dynamic\nequilibrium. We define the reaction quotient, Q, as the ratio of\n[C]c[D]d\n[A]a[B]b\n\nThis expression for Q can be evaluated at any point during the reaction, whether the system has\nreached equilibrium or not. BUT, we have a special way to call Q once the system is in dynamic\nequilibrium, and that's with the letter K, or the equilibrium constant for the reaction. Often, we\nput a subscript \"eq\" on the K just to make sure we know what it refers to, so Keq = Q (for the\nreaction quotient in equilibrium). The Keq for a solid dissolving in water is the solubility product\n(Ksp).\nAgCl Ksp figure removed due to copyright restrictions.\nBy comparing the value of Q to the equilibrium constant, Keq, for the reaction, we can determine\nwhether the forward reaction or reverse reaction will be favored.\nIf Q = Keq, the reaction is at equilibrium. If Q < Keq, like at point D, then the reaction will\nmove to the right (in the forward direction) in order to reach equilibrium. If Q > Keq, like in point\nE, then the reaction will move to the left (in the reverse direction) in order to reach equilibrium.

For information, see https://ocw.mit.edu/fairuse.\n\nWhy this matters\nFrom examining the tiny bubbles trapped in ice cores, we know that the level of CO2 currently in the\natmosphere is more than it has been in over a million years, and the amount is growing exponentially.\nBut while this incredibly important greenhouse gas has received tremendous attention for its\nrole in climate change, there is a much less frequently dis\ncussed impact that CO2 is having on our planet.\nMaybe\nthat's because it's happening in the oceans, which we don't\nlive in so it's harder to make as big of a deal about\nCO2 Time Series in the North Pacific graph\nthe changes occurring.\nBut we will feel these changes\nremoved due to copyright restrictions.\nsoon enough.\nThe ocean has absorbed more than 500\nbillion tons of CO2\nfrom the atmosphere,\nas it quietly\ncaptures roughly a quarter of what's being emitted day\nin and day out (today we humans crank out 1,200,000\ngrams of CO2\nper second).\nSo why does this mat\nter?\nThe problem with all that extra CO2 in the oceans is that it makes the water more acidic. Over\nthe past 200 years alone, ocean water has become 30 percent more\nacidic. This change in acidity is faster than any known change\nin ocean chemistry over the last 50 million years! In geological\nPhotos of dissolving pteropod shells\nterms, this is an extremely abrupt perturbation, and without dra\nremoved due to copyright restrictions. matic changes in human behavior we are only seeing the begin\nning.\nUnfortunately, one of the most important defenses for ocean crea\ntures - the shell - cannot survive increased acidity. Here's a picture\nof what happens to the shell of a pteropod, a type of mollusk only a\nfew cm long, after 45 days in a solution of pH=7.8. Now, the oceans\naren't quite that acidic yet (current ocean pH is 8.1), but they're well on their way. Pteropods are\none of only a few basic types of sea creature that sits at the very bottom of the ocean food chain,\nright above plankton and seaweed, which means that if their numbers are reduced, everything higher\non the food chain is impacted, from krill to salmon, to herring and birds, to seals and polar bears,\nand of course, to us.\nIn the goodie bag that goes with these lectures, you'll be able to see this dissolution in action.\nWe make it go faster than 45 days since I don't want you to wait that long, but the chemistry at\nplay is the same. I wanted you to touch and feel this precious calcium carbonate loss, so that you\ncan get a glimpse into what is beginning to happen to 2/3 of our planet.\nWhy this employs\nIn order for drugs to have a physiological effect on the human body, they must be in solution. In\nparticular, they must be dissolved in solution if they start out in solid form, like tablets do. Now,\nthe rate of the dissolution is extremely important since determines how fast the drug is absorbed in\n\nthe body. Rates were discussed in the last chapter. But solubility itself (i.e. regardless of how fast\nit dissolves, what is its ability to fully dissolve at all?) is also of crucial importance in drug design.\nIf the drug is not very soluble, formulations can lead to difficulties in the use of the drug which\nmay otherwise have very beneficial effects. If a drug has low solubility that means it will likely have\na low level of what is called \"bioavailability,\" which basically just means that it won't get enough\nexposure in the body.\nIn pharmaceutical companies that do most of the new drug development, it is estimated that a\nwhopping 40% of all new chemicals (possible new beneficial drugs) are practically insoluble in wa\nter, making them effectively useless. And what is it that these companies do to try to increase\nsolubility, especially for otherwise promising candidates? Chemical modification, of course! And so\nit is that all of the large pharmaceutical companies are looking for people who know about solubility!\nIn terms of where to look for jobs, the thing about drug design companies is that you don't have to\nlook very far. withinWithin just 1 mile of campus, there are dozens of both large and small com\npanies specializing in drug design. More broadly, Kendall Square now has the largest biotechnology\nindustry per square foot, with over 120 companies within a mile.\nIn terms of which ones of these companies have jobs related to solubility, well because of how\nimportant solubility is, it's pretty much all of them. Check out for example, the job postings at\nTakeda, Novartis, Alnylam, Sanofi, Pfizer, and Genentech just to get started, and then walk down\nthe street to go learn more about the companies, what they do, and meet with them in person!\nExample Problems\n1.

How much calcium fluoride can dissolve in 1L of water?\n\nSolutions\n1.\nksp = [Ca][F ]2\nFor every mole of Ca that dissolves, twice as many moles of F must dissolve since the chemical\nformula is CaF2.

Although we write H+ to make the proton dissociation explicit, we never actually\nmean that if it's in water. That's because the H+ ion is not stable in H2O, instead it always be\ncomes H3O+ . The first person to define acids and bases in any sort of more concrete chemical way\nwas good old Svante Arrhenius. According to him, an acid is a substance that dissolves in water to\nproduce H+ ions, and a base is a substance that dissolves in water to produce hydroxide (OH-) ions.\nArrhenius defined acids and bases in terms of the presence of H+ or OH- ions in solution: for\nexample,HCl(aq) → H+(aq) + Cl-(aq) is an \"Arrhenius acid\" while NaOH(s) → Na+(aq) +\nOH-(aq) an \"Arrhenius base.\"\nSorenson came up with the \"power of hydrogen\" scale, or \"pH\" scale for short. pH = -log[H+].\nThe pH scale runs from 0 to 14, with 0 being extremely acidic and 14 being extremely basic. We\ncan do the same thing for the concentration of [OH-]: the power of OH- in solution, or the \"pOH\"\n= -log[OH-], with the opposite definition.\n\nA strong acid like HCl fully dissociates: HCl + H2O → H+ + Cl- + H2O, so 0.1 M HCl has\n[H+] =0.1, so 0.1 M HCl solution has pH = -log[0.1] = 1.0.\nSome materials can be both acids and bases. None other than water itself is one such material!\nWhen a molecule can either give [H+] ions or [OH-] ions into solution, it's called amphoteric:\nH2O(l) + H2O(l) ↔ H3O+(aq) + OH-(aq). Ksp for water is called Kw: Kw = [H3O+][OH-] =\n1.0 × 10-14 . If an acid is added to pure water the hydrogen ion concentration increases (and the OH\nion concentration decreases) A base goes the other way, adding hydroxide ions into the pure water\nsolution. All of the tricks we learned for Ksp apply to Kw, which is especially useful in the context\nof acids and bases.\nArrhenius' definition of acids and bases has two key limitations: first, because acids and bases were\ndefined in terms of ions obtained from water, the Arrhenius definition applied only to molecules in\naqueous solution. Second, and more important, the Arrhenius definition predicted that only materi\nals that dissolve in water to give H+ and OH- ions can have the properties of acids and bases. But\nthere are many examples where this is not true! We need to go beyond Arrhenius to understand\nsome acids and bases.\nWhy this matters\nNow that we're armed with the concepts of the Common Ion Effect and Le Chatelier's principle, we\ncan go into more detail on the chemistry that's causing the possible catastrophe discussed in the\nprevious Why This Matters: ocean acidification and its impact on the fate of calcium carbonate. It's\nall about equilibrium and how CO2 is shifting it in the oceans. The first reaction we consider is what\nhappens when the oceans encounter more CO2 from the atmosphere: namely, the CO2 dissolves in\nthe H2O to form carbonic acid:\nCO2 + H2O ↔ H2CO3\nSo more CO2 getting dissolved in the ocean means there's more carbonic acid in the ocean, which\nthen produces dissociated ions as follows:\nH2CO3 ↔ HCO- + H+\nBut on the other hand, we've got solid CaCO3 which is the calcium carbonate, that is in a nice\nequilibrium with the following dissociation reaction:\nCaCO3 ↔ Ca2+ + CO2-\nThe equilibrium constant for the dissolution of CaCO3 is ksp = 5 × 10-9 . That means not a whole\nlot of it will dissociate in \"normal\" (i.e. last >50 million years) ocean conditions. The reason this\nequilibrium is getting thrown off is that there are now extra H+ ions that come from the CO2 reaction\nabove. These H+ ions consume (react with) CO2- to form HCO3- which lowers the concentration\nof CO2- . Ah, but we just learned about that with the Common Ion Effect: if we add or take away\nsome molecule that's part of a balanced equilibrium, then we will drive that equilibrium to counter\nwhatever we've done. In this case , CO2- is getting consumed more than before, which in turn\n\ndrives more dissolution of the CaCO3. That's why the shells are dissolving, and it's why I want you\nto experience this chemistry directly in your goodie bag. What you're seeing is those experiments\nis an accelerated version of what is happening in the oceans.\nAcidity is measured by \"pH,\" which is a logarithmic scale. Since the Industrial Revolution, the\npH of the oceans has decreased by ≈ 0.1 to 8.07, which is equivalent to a ≈30% increase in the\noceans' acidity. I showed that trend in last lecture's Why This Matters. Estimates are that at our\ncurrent rate of CO2 emissions, the acidity of the oceans will reach a whoppingly more acidic state\nof pH=7.7 by 2100. That would represent a >5-fold increase in acidity compared to pre-industrial\nlevels, and that would also pretty much do it in terms of wiping out most ocean life.\nThe ocean has absorbed roughly 525 billion tons of CO2 from the atmosphere over the past 200\nyears, at a pace of ≈ 22 million tons per day. The change that this induces is the fastest known\nchemical change the ocean has experienced over the past 50 million years and probably much longer.\nAround 250 million years ago, at the end of what is known as the \"Permian era,\" records show that\nthere was a sudden change in the oceans, and geologists refer to what happened as, \"The Great\nDying.\" This is because more than 90% of all marine life disappeared from the fossil record. Most\nscientists who study this kind of thing relate the mass extinction to a huge spike in volcanic activity,\nwhich put vast clouds of acidic dust into the atmosphere, which then fell into the oceans and raised\ntheir acidity.\nThe reason the dissolution of calcium carbonate is so important is that it is essential not just\nto the pteropods I showed before, but to so many other \"base\" elements of the ocean's food chain,\nlike phytoplankton, shell fish (mussels, oysters, lobsters, crayfish, etc), and of course coral, to name\nonly a few examples. The calcium carbonate structures in these sea creatures are highly sensitive to\nslight changes in acidity, and without them the health of the oceans will fail. I'll end this Why This\nMatters with a thought-provoking quote from Ken Caldeira who is a climate scientist at Stanford.\nIn trying to help people get perspective on what we're doing, he said, \"Well, if the Romans had\nindustrialized, it now would be two thousand years later. The seas would still be rising and still be\ncompletely acidified, and, yes, maybe they would have got a century or so of higher G.D.P. than\nthey would have otherwise.\" The point being: the deleterious changes we're on track to make in the\noceans won't just impact our kids, and our kids' kids; it will impact tens and more likely hundreds\nof generations to come.\nWhy this employs\nI talked about ocean acidification in this lecture since we're introducing acids and bases, and what's\ngoing on in the oceans is a good example of the effects of chemistry happening on a planetary scale.\nBut what if you want to actually work on this problem, like as a job? Well, that's not as straight\nforward as you might think, or for that matter may have hoped, but there are some things you can do.\nFor one thing, there are many, many academic or state-run programs that are studying ocean\nchemistry, and many of them have postings for jobs. This ranges from a random ocean acidification\nproject at the Universita Di' Bologna, Italy, to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra\n\ntion Cooperative Science Center for Earth System Sciences and Remote Sensing Technologies (yes,\nthankfully they go by NOAA-CESSRST), to other government agencies such as the EPA or any\nagency working in conservation and policy, to Washington State's Department of Ecology, to Stony\nBrook University who is currently seeking an, \"Ocean Acidification Monitoring Associate.\" There\nare many faculty positions in this area, and I believe there will be more in the future. So if you're\ninterested in both this topic as well as a career in academia, then the path of research in scientific\ncenters is a good one. There are a number of different specializations that would lead to studying\n(and hopefully helping to save!) the oceans, from marine biologist to environmental engineer to a\n\"chemical oceanographer,\" who is kind of like an oceanographer but specializing in the chemical\ncomposition of the oceans rather than their ecology, biological life and geology.\nExample problems\n1. Hydrofluoric acid reacts with calcium carbonate according to the following equation:\n2HF (aq) + CaCO3 → H2O(l) + CO2(g) + CaF2\nIf 100 mL of a 10mM solution of HF is added to 100 mL of a 10mM solution of CaCO3, how much\nCaF2 will precipitate? Assume the reaction goes to completion.\n\nSolutions\n1. In this problem, the first clue is that the reaction \"goes to completion:\" this indicates that we\ndon't need to worry about equilibrium. When a 10mM solution of HF is added to a 10mM solution\nof CaCO3, the final solution has a different concentration.\nThe original solutions each contain 1 mmol of material, since 0.1L ∗ 10mmol/L = 1mmol. The\nfinal solution, therefore, has 1 mmol Hf and 1mmol CaCO3 in 0.2L of water, so the concentration\nof the final solution is 5 mM in both reactants.\nNext, we need to think about how much CaF2 we can form: if we start with 1 mmol of HF and\n1 mmol CaCO3, you can check that the limiting reagent is CaCO3, since we need twice as much\nHF as CaCO3 to form CaF2. We'll end up with 0.5 mmol CaF2, and leave behind 0.5mmol CaCO3.\nNext, we need to determine how much will dissolve. We can use an ICE table and the common\nion effect. We start with 0.5mmol of calcium ions in 0.2 L = 0.25mM:\nCaF2\nCa2+\n2F -\nI\n2.5 mM\n0 mM\nC\n+ x\n+2x\nE\n2.5+x\n2x\n5.3 × 10-9 = (.0025 + x)(2x)2\nx = 0.000649\nTherefore, 0.649 mM will be soluble, leaving 2.5mM-0.649mM=1.85mM CaF2 will precipitate.\n1.85mmol/L ∗ 0.2L = 0.37mmol\n0.37mmol ∗ 78.07g/mol = 28.9mgCaF2\nTherefore, 28.9 mg of CaF2 will precipitate.\n\nLecture 30: Bronsted-Lowry Acids/Bases and Neutralization\nSummary\nIn this lecture, we started by considering what happens if you combine an acid and a base directly:\nfor example, NaOH(aq)+HCl(aq) → H2O(l) + NaCl(s). Each of these products, the water and the\nsalt, find an equilibrium of their own. So the arrow goes both ways H+ + OH- ↔ H2O(l) and\nwater gives the usual neutral ion concentrations of H+ and OH-. Salt also will have its equilibrium\nreaction to form ions Na+ and Cl- in solution. Sometime the Na+ and Cl- ions called \"spectators\"\nwhen in solution, since they don't participate in making the solution either acidic or basic. The\nreaction of an acid with a base to make water and salt is called a neutralization reaction.\nBronsted and Lowry defined acids and bases more broadly: a Bronsted-Lowry acid is anything\nthat releases H+ ions. A Bronsted-Lowry base is anything\nthat accepts H+ ions. A \"conjugate pair\" is a nice way\nto keep track of the proton transfer that happens in\nacid/base chemistry. If we consider the generic reaction\nHA + H2O, where we label the A for \"acid\" and purpose\nfully write the H separately since we know as an acid it\nwill be giving that H up as a H+ ion, the molecule left\nover after giving up the H+ ion into solution, A-, is called\nits conjugate pair. Similarly, if it reacted with H2O, then\nthe H2O gained the H+ to become H3O+ , and those two\nmolecules are conjugate pairs. According to Bronsted-Lowry, an acid base reaction is essentially just\na proton transfer reaction.\nA general way to write an acid mixing with a base would be: HA + B → BH+ + A- where\nhere it is very clear that the acid transfers a proton to the base.\nHow do we know why and when an acid or base is \"strong\" vs. \"weak?\" This table lists\ncommon strong acids and bases.\nAcids other than\nthese six are essentially all weak acids.\nThe only com\nmon strong bases are the hydroxides of the alkali met\nals and the heavier alkaline earths (Ca, Sr, and Ba);\nany other bases are likely to be weak.\nWe can quan\ntify why these molecules are considered \"strong\" by con\nsidering their acid dissociation constants.\nFor HCl, the\nacid dissociation constant, or in other words the equi\nlibrium constant for the acid, Ka = [H3O+][Cl-]/[HCl]\n≈ 106 - this is huge, and it means effectively full\ndissociation.\nA strong acid like HCl is in fact\nstrong because it fully dissociates.\nAnd the oppo\nsite is true too:\nif an acid fully dissociates, then\nit is a strong acid.\nThe same applies for strong\nbases.\n\nFor example, suppose you have a 1.0 M solution of CH3COOH. That means that there's 1 mole\nof CH3COOH in a liter of water. Since Ka = 10-5 , that means that [H3O+] for this 1M solution is\naround 0.003, which in turn means that the pH of 1M CH3COOH is about 2.5. Note that if there's\n0.003 moles of [H3O+] that can from 1 mole of CH3COOH, then that means that only 0.3% of it\ndissolved. That's not a lot of dissolution compared to the near 100% for the strong acids!\nHere's another example: will the salt formed from the following reaction have a pH greater than,\nless than, or equal to 7? CH3COOH(aq) + NaOH(s)↔Na+ + CH3COO-(aq) + H2O(l) To answer\nthis we don't even need to do any math. That's because if a weak acid is mixed with a strong base\n(as is the case here), we automatically know that it will be basic.\nIn general, when the following are mixed, the results are:\n- Weak acid mixed with weak base:\npH < 7 for Ka > Kb; pH = 7 if Ka = Kb; pH > 7 for Ka < Kb\n- Strong acid mixed with string base: pH = 7\n- Strong acid mixed with weak base: pH < 7\n- Strong base mixed with weak acid: pH > 7\nWhy this matters\nIt might feel a bit on the hot side at 470°C, and you'd be surrounded by sulfuric acid most of the\ntime. That's what it would be like if you lived on Venus. Here's a nice picture from a Russian\nspace probe back in the 1970's that landed on the surface, showing what a stroll would be like over\nthere. These temperatures and acidic atmospheres may sound crazy, but many materials require\nsimilar conditions for processing. A lot of aspects of our industrial revolution have effectively relied\non reproducing the conditions of Venus! In fact, today, nearly 250 million tons of sulfuric acid is\nproduced per year, which makes it one of the largest chemicals produced worldwide. The liberated\nH+ ions that come from H2SO4 are put to use in a wide range of industries, from detergents to\nlead-acid car batteries to dyes to metal processing, it is in the production of fertilizers where its use\ndominates: roughly 50% of all sulfuric acid is used to make fertilizer!\nIn one of our earlier Why This Matters, we discussed the Haber-Bosch process, which uses a catalyst,\nhigh temperatures (like ≈400°C), and high pressures (like ≈180 atm.) to fix N2 molecules and turn\nthem into ammonia, NH3. But the thing is, that's only one of the three most important ingredients\nplants need to grow: the other two are phosphorus and potassium. Phosphorus, in particular, is\ntypically made with vast amounts of sulfuric acid. Why is this the case? You already know the\nanswer, it's the chemistry.\nfound in sedimentary deposits, meaning that they formed by deposition of phosphate-rich mate\nrials in marine environments. Here's a picture of a phosphate rock formation being mined in Utah.\nBut if you take phosphate rock and grind it up into a powder, it still won't be very soluble in water\n\n(we now have some knowledge about what that means!). This means that if you put the mineral\ndirectly into fertilizer, it will not be useful to plants. It's just like for the case of N2 in the air: even\nthough there's plenty of N2, plants have no way of absorbing it. Rather, they need to work with\nNH3 in order to take in nitrogen. The same thing is true for phosphorus: tricalcium phosphate,\nCa3(PO4)2, which is what phosphate rock mostly consists of, is not able to give phosphorus to\nplants because it doesn't dissolve enough in water. The Ksp for this ionic salt is a whoppingly low\n2.07 × 10-33! By the way, it's a pretty good thing that this doesn't dissolve very much since it's a\nkey ingredient in bones and teeth.\nThat's where sulfuric acid comes in: it's a fairly simple way to liberate the phosphoric acid H3PO4\nfrom the phosphate rock. In particular, the H2SO4 from the phosphate rock. In particular, the\nH2SO4 gives up its hydrogen in exchange for the calcium to form calcium sulfate, as follows:\nCa3(PO4)2 + 3H2SO4 → 2H3PO4 + 3CaSO4\nOnce the phosphoric acid is produced in this manner, it can then be made into different types\nof fertilizer that are now water-soluble, so the plants can absorb it. These are generally termed\n\"phosphates,\" or salts of phosphoric acid, which in the context of fertilizers include ammonium\nphosphates, calcium phosphates, and sodium phosphates. Bottom line: we feed the world because\nof our knowledge of acid/base chemistry!\nWhy this employs\nAcids and bases are used so much in industry and in life: it's not hard to find jobs that involve\nacids and bases. You could check out DuPont, for example, which sells phosphate fertilizer plants\nthat do just what we discussed above (for example, see http://cleantechnologies.dupont.com/\nindustries/phosphate-fertilizer/). http://cleantechnologies.dupont.com/industries/phosphate\nfertilizer/). BASF was one of the very first companies to make and sell sulfuric acid on large scales,\nand they still do and have many job openings related to acid chemistry. There's Sigma Aldrich,\nwhich is a massive company with 10,000 employees and nearly $3B in annual revenue: their \"acids\nand bases\" category shows hundreds of products (btw, another company, Merck, bought them re\ncently for $17B). Or how about Cabot Laboratories, which doesn't make acids and bases explicitly\nbut uses them to make every one of the cool chemical products they do make, whether elastomers\nor aerogels or \"advanced carbons.\"\nYou could take any one of many different acids, look up its name, and likely find a market for\nit, and then all the companies that either make it or use it, many of which will have jobs related to\nit. Take formic acid: it's getting more interest from a range of different industries because it's easier\nto handle than other acids (see for example this article about it in C&EN (https://cen.acs.org/\narticles/93/i48/Chemical-Makers-Eyes-Formic-Acid.html), and is used heavily in the textiles\nindustry. BASF and Eastman Chemical are big on formic acid, but a lot of other companies are\ngetting interested. Speaking of textiles, that's another industry that uses massive amounts of acids,\nincluding formic acid but also citric, acetic, hydrochloric, and nitric acid. Textiles also rely heavily\non bases like sodium hydroxide and baking soda for dyeing, cleaning, and fire-proofing clothes to\nname a few uses. All just to say that acids and bases and truly a bedrock of industry, and knowing\nhow to make them or how to use them leads to massive job opportunities.\n\nExample Problems\n1.

      "content": "From Arrhenius to Vacancy Formation: Xtra Notes\nWe began with the general Arrhenius relation. Many phenomena\ndepend not just on energy but on the energy of some process\nrelative to thermal energy. When the process is \"thermally\nactivated\" the Arrhenius relationship can describe its rate.\nRate (how often the\nActivation energy for\nprocess occurs in time)\nK = A * e -(Ea/RT)\nprocess to occur\nAverage\nthermal\nPre-exponential (also\nkinetic energy\ncalled \"frequency factor\")\nSome things: 1)\nif the Ea is per mole use the gas constant R (8.314 J/mol*K), if it's per\natom use the Boltzmann constant KB (8.62x10-5 eV/K)\n2)\nThe pre-exponential factor A is related to how the process is\nattempted (we learn about it more later when we do reaction rates)\n3)\nEa is the energy required to \"activate\" the process. It's also known as\nthe barrier height for a standard reaction coordinate vs. Energy plot.\n4)\nThe units of K and A must be the same, as with Ea and RT (or KBT).\n\nFrom Arrhenius to Vacancy Formation: Xtra Notes\nK=A*e -(Ea/RT) ln(K)=ln(A)-Ea/RT\nTake the log of the Arrhenius equation and we get a nice linear\nrelationship between ln(K) and 1/T, like this:\nSome things:\nY-intercept = lnA\n1)\nThis is sometimes called an\n\"Arrhenius plot,\" showing the\ninverse relation between reaction\nrates and temperature\n2)\nThe negative slope gives the\nactivation energy, Ea: slope = -Ea/R\nslope=-Ea/R\n3)\nExtrapolation of the Arrhenius plot\nln(k)\nback to the y-intercept gives ln(A)\n4)\nThis plot shows how activation\nenergy and temperature affect the\nsensitivity of the reaction rate\n1/Temperature\n\nFrom Arrhenius to Vacancy Formation: Xtra Notes\nNext we related a thermally activated process to vacancy\nformation. A vacancy is formed by a surface atom moving up and\ncreating room for the vacancy. Likewise a vacancy can \"un\nform\" (or as it's also called, annihilate).\nExample of vacancy moving\nby one atomic position\nVacancies come from and\ngo to the surface\nThe forming (call it rate 1) and un-forming (call it rate 2)\nof vacancies are both thermally activated processes:\nK1=A1*e -(Ea1/RT) K2=A2*e -(Ea2/RT)\n\nFrom Arrhenius to Vacancy Formation: Xtra Notes\nK1=A1*e -(Ea1/RT) K2=A2*e -(Ea2/RT)\n-The simplest rate has units 1/s. Then the flux of vacancies that\nform or un-form must multiply this rate by the number we have.\n-Flux of vacancies that form = number of sites N that could\nform vacancies times the rate of forming vacancies K1\n-Flux of vacancies that un-form = number of sites NV that could\nun-form vacancies times the rate of un-forming vacancies K2\n-The system is in equilibrium (meaning the number of vacancies\ndoesn't change) when the flux of forming vacancies is equal to\nthe flux of un-forming vacancies.\n-In other words, N*K1 = NV*K2 --> NV/N = K1/K2\n-And we have now an expression for the vacancy concentration\nin equilibrium!\n\nFrom Arrhenius to Vacancy Formation: Xtra Notes\n-Note that N is the number of sites that have an atom occupying\nthem but could become a vacancy. But we just let this = to the\nnumber of lattice sites since that's a good approximation (it's\nmuch much larger than NV).\n-Do a little math and we get:\nNV/N=(A1/A2)*e -((Ea1-Ea2)/RT\nWe assume the frequency factors are\nroughly the same, and finally get:\nK2=A2*e -(Ea2/RT)\nK1=A1*e -(Ea1/RT)\nEa1-Ea2\nEa1\nEa2\nNV/N=e -Ev/RT\nWhere Ev is the vacancy formation\nenergy that is sometimes called Ev,\nand other times Qv, and other times\n(incorrectly) Ea\n\nFrom Arrhenius to Vacancy Formation: Xtra Notes\nNV/N=e -Ev/RT\n-This is the key equation\nyou should know related to\nvacancy concentration\n-So why did I show you all\nthat general Arrhenius\nstuff?\nslope=-Ev/R\n1/Temperature\nln(Nv/N)\nThe Arrhenius plot for vacancy\nconcentration looks like this\n-Because 1) that's where\nthis relation for vacancies\ncomes from, and 2) you'll\nneed to know about\nArrhenius for other topics\nso good to lay the\ngroundwork here.\nRemember that N is the number\nof possible vacancy sites (that's\njust the number of atoms!) and Nv\nis the number of vacancies.

If this other salt has a common ion, it can have a\nhuge effect.\nFor example, suppose we put 0.1 M of NaCl into the solution,\nand that this salt dissolves fully into Na+ and Cl-. This adds\n0.1 M of Cl- ions, and changes the equilibrium.\n\nWe can go back to the ICE table, but now we start with AgCl\nin equilibrium, we add 0.1M to the Cl- column.\nLet x=amount of Ag+ and Cl- that react to form AgCl (in other\nwords they precipitate). We know they must precipitate\nbecause Ksp is still the same constant, and we've increased\n[Cl-] from the addition of NaCl.

One glass is then cooled more quickly than\nthe other. Which graph represents the molar volume\nvs. T curve of the two glasses?\nThe answer is (a) since it has T1 correctly greater than Tm (past\nTg1 and Tg2), and it has the two slopes of the glasses the same.\n\n- We used cooling rate as an example for how to engineer\nthe mechanical properties of glass.\n- In a process called tempering, the outside layer is cooled\nmore rapidly than the inside, leading to a \"desire\" for the\ninside to have a smaller volume (slower cooling rate).\n- This can be understood from the curves drawn on the\nprevious slides, with for example glass (b) being the\nsurface layer and (a) being the inside.\n- The volume change between surface and core leads to\n(sometimes huge) compressive stress which makes the\nglass stronger.\n\nSilica\nSiO2\n73.6%\n80.0%\n35.0%\n96.5%\n67.0%\nSoda\nNa2O\n16.0\n--\n--\n18.0\nLime\nCaO\n5.2\n--\n--\n--\n8.0\nPotash\nK2O\n0.6\n0.4\n7.2\n--\n1.0\nMagnesia\nMgO\n3.6\n--\n--\n--\n1.0\nAlumina\nAl2O3\n1.0\n2.0\n--\n0.5\n2.5\nIron Oxide\nFe2O3\n--\n--\n--\n--\n0.5\nBoric\nOxide\nB2O3\n--\n13.0\n--\n3.0\n--\nLead\nOxide\nPbO\n--\n--\n58.0\n--\n0.01\nbottles/\nwindows\nBakeware/\nlab glass Optical\nHigh\nTemp\nAncient\nRome\nhttps://www.cmog.org/article/chemistry-glass\nGlass can be widely engineered, by changing the\ncooling rate as discussed above or by adding\nchemistry (a \"modifier\"), that provides O2-.\n\nNote something in common with all glass\nmodifiers: gives O2- For example:\nCaO --> Ca(2+) + O(2-)\nNa2O --> 2Na(1+) + O(2-)\nAl2O3 --> 2Al(3+) + 3O(2-)\nO2- attacks the Si-O-Si bond and breaks it.\nThis its called chain scission since the chain is\nbroken (shorter pasta)\n\nStock image of spaghetti (c) source unknown.

They are\nusually written as a sum of reactants, which when combined yield a sum of products:\nA + B → C + D\nHere, A, B, C, and D represent chemical compounds. The fundamental principle guiding the process of\nbalancing a reaction is conservation of mass: a chemical reaction cannot create or destroy mass! This has\nseveral implications that can be used to determine whether a reaction is valid:\n1. The mass of the reactants must equal the mass of the products\n2. Every element that is in a reactant must be in a product\n3. The number of each type of atom in the reactants must equal the number of each type of atom in the\nproducts\nExample: Ethylene and oxygen gas are combined to make water and carbon dioxide. If you start with 4\nmoles of O2 gas, how many moles of water and carbon dioxide can you make? The unbalanced equation is\ngiven below:\nC2H4 + O2 → CO2 + H2O\nFirst, we must balance the reaction. One method to do this is by using a table:\nC\nH\nO\nC\nH\nO\nInitial (unbalanced):\nNeed: even number of oxygens\nTry: 2 × H2O on the right\nNeed: even number of carbons\nTry: 2 × CO2 on the right:\nNeed: more oxygen on the left\nTry: 3 × O2 on the left\nOnce there are the same number of each elements on both sides of the reaction, we're done balancing! The\nfinal reaction is\nC2H4 + 3O2 → 2CO2 + 2H2O\nThe greatest common factor between the coefficients in front of each compound is 1, so this is the simplest\nform.\nYield\nThe yield of a reaction is the maximum amount of products that can be made with the reactants that are\nput in. For example, consider a s'more, which consists of a marshmallow, a piece of chocolate, and two\ngraham crackers. If you had 5 marshmallows, 4 pieces of chocolate, and 6 graham crackers, you could make\n3 full s'mores (with 2 extra marshmallows and 1 extra marshmallow). We combine chemical compounds in\nthe same way!\n\n3.091: Introduction to Solid State Chemistry\nMaddie Sutula, Fall 2018\nRecitation 1\nExample: Ammonia (NH3) is produced when nitrogen gas (N2) is combined with hydrogen gas (H2).\nWrite a balanced equation for this reaction, and determine how much ammonia can be produced if you start\nwith 5 moles of hydrogen gas.\nFirst, let's balance the reaction. We can try some coefficients by inspection and verify they satisfy con\nservation of mass:\nN2 + 3H2 → 2NH3\nThis balanced reaction tells us that for every three moles of H2 gas, we can make two moles of ammonia.\nTherefore, if we start with 5 moles of H2:\n2 moles of NH3\n5 moles of H2 ×\n= 3.33 moles of NH3\n3 moles of H2\nLimiting reagents\nIf we don't start with the right stoichiometric ratios of reagents, there might be some reactant left over\nafter we have formed the products. If we go back to the s'mores example, we were able to make three full\ns'mores, with extra chocolate and marshmallow. Since all of the graham crackers were used before the other\nreactants, they are the limiting reagent. The limiting reagent is specific to the initial amount of reactants\navailable.\nExample: The Kroll process for making titanium metal out of titanium chloride is:\nTiCl4 + Mg → MgCL2 + Ti\nYou react 25kg of Mg with 200kg of T iCl4.\na) Balance the reaction, b) determine the limiting reagent, and c) determine the yield of Ti in this reaction.\na) To balance the reaction, we can start by looking at the Cl atoms: we need to double the MgCl2 on\nthe right to equal the left. Then, we just need to balance the Mg atoms: we need double on the right to\naccount for the extra we just created on the left. The balanced reaction is therefore\nT iCl4 + 2Mg → 2MgCl2 + Ti\nb) To find the limiting reagent, we need to find the molar mass of the reactants:\nT iCl4: 47.87 + 4 × 25.45 = 189.7g/mol\nMg: 24.3g/mol\nNext, we can convert from grams to moles:\n1000 g T iCl4\n1 mol T iCl4\n200 kg T iCl4 ×\n×\n= 1054 mol T iCl4\n1 kg T iCl4\n189.7 g T iCl4\n1000 g Mg\n1 mol Mg\n15 kg Mg ×\n×\n= 1029 mol Mg\n1 kg Mg\n24.3 g Mg\nThe balanced reaction tells us we need twice as many moles of magnesium as moles of titanium chloride.\nWe don't have enough Mg to react with all of the T iCl4, so Mg is the limiting reagent.\nc) The yield is determined by the initial amount of the limiting reagent. The balanced reaction tells us we\nget two moles of MgCl2 and 1 mole of Ti per mole of Mg we react, so the yield is\n1029 mol Mg × 1 mol Ti\n2 mol Mg × 47.87 g Ti\n1 mol Ti = 24.7 kg of Ti\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu/\n3.091 Introduction to Solid-State Chemistry\nFall 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "3.091: Introduction to Solid State Chemistry\nMaddie Sutula, Fall 2018\nRecitation 2\nAvogadro and moles\nWhen balancing a reaction or determining its yield, it was really important to keep track of the number of\neach kind of atom before and after the reaction. Atoms can be difficult to account for in real life due to their\nminuscule size. Instead, we usually keep track in moles: a mole consists of Avogadro's number of atoms (or\nmolecules), or 6.022 × 1023 atoms or molecules per mole.\nCritically, we can convert from moles to a value that is easy to measure in a lab: mass. The molar mass\nof a a substance is defined to be the number of grams in one mole of that substance. The molar mass of a\nsingle element is also called the atomic mass; the molar mass of a compound can be obtained by summing\nthe molar mass of the constituent elements.\nExample:\nHow many moles of nickel are in 102 g of nickel? How many moles of H2O are in 50 g of\nwater?\n1 mol Ni\n102 g Ni ×\n= 1.74 mol Ni\n58.69 g Ni\n1 mol H2O\n50 g H2O × (15.999 + 2 × 1.0107) g H2O = 2.77 mol H2O\nPeriodic table\nThe periodic table is our key to solving problems! It contains a wealth of information that we can use to\nunderstand and calculate the properties of materials. The elements are organized by the number of protons:\nthe rows are called periods, and the columns are called groups. Atoms are made up of positively charged\nprotons, neutral neutrons, and negatively charged electrons. Protons and neutrons live at the center of the\natom: together, these are the main source of mass. Electrons orbit around the protons and neutrons (more\non this later). An example Bohr model of carbon is shown here:\nWe can read off many properties of atoms from the periodic table: An atom has the same number of protons\nand electrons. The atomic mass is the sum of the number of protons and neutrons: it is the average mass\nof one atom of each element. The units of atomic mass are AMU (atomic mass units, = 1/12 the mass of\na carbon-12 isotope), or equivalently (due to a convenient convention), the number of grams in a mole of a\nsubstance.\n\n3.091: Introduction to Solid State Chemistry\nMaddie Sutula, Fall 2018\nRecitation 2\nIsotopes\nYou may have noticed that the atomic masses on the periodic table aren't integers, even though the number\nof protons + neutrons must be an integer. The number represented as atomic mass is really the average\natomic mass, where a weighted average is taken over the possible isotopes of an atom. An isotope is an\natom that has a few extra (or missing) neutrons, and therefore a different atomic mass. Isotopes are usually\nwritten like this:\nA\nZ X\nHere, X is the element symbol, Z is the atomic number, and A is the atomic mass. The number of neutrons\nin the isotope is just\n# neutrons = A - Z\nExample: Complete the following table:\nIsotope\nAbundance\nAtomic mass (amu)\n28Si\n92.18%\n29Si\n?\nxSi\n3.12%\n?\nFrom the periodic table, the average atomic mass of silicon is 28.0855 amu. First, we can solve for the\npercentage of 29Si by using the fact that the total abundance must sum to 100%:\n100% = 92.18% + 3.12% + y\ny = 4.71%\nThen, we can use a weighted average to calculate the atomic mass and determine what the third isotope is:\n28.0855 = 0.9218 × (28amu) + 0.0471 × (29amu) + 0.0312x\nx = 30\nCombustion\nA combustion reaction occurs when a substance reacts with oxygen gas, producing light and heat.\nExample:\nIf you put 400 g of sugar (glucose) into a 1m box, light it on fire, and quickly seal the\nbox, would there be enough oxygen to completely combust the sugar? Write a balanced reaction; determine\nthe limiting reagent and yield.\nDensity of air: 1.225 g/L = 1.225 kg/m\nOxyten weight percentage in air: 23.2%\nChemical forula of glucose: C6H12O6\nWe can try to match the number of moles in the glucose by adjusting the coefficients on the right side.\nThis gives the right number of C and H. Finally, we can adjust the coefficient on the oxygen to get a bal\nanced reaction:\nC6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O\n\n3.091: Introduction to Solid State Chemistry\nMaddie Sutula, Fall 2018\nRecitation 2\nTo determine the limiting reagent, we need to figure out how many moles of each reactant we have:\n1 mol glucose\n400 g glucose ×\n= 2.22 mol glucose\n(6 × 12.0107 + 12 × 1.01 + 6 × 15.999) g glucose\nNext, we need to determine how much oxygen is in the box:\n1.225 kg air\n1000g\n1 mol oxygen\n1 m 3 air ×\n×\n× 0.232 ×\n= 8.88 mol oxygen\n1 m3 air\nkg\n2 × 15.999 g oxygen\nwhere the multiplication by 0.232 to account for the fact that air is 23.2% oxygen.\nWe need 6 times as much oxygen as glucose to fully react, and 6.66/2.22 ≤ 6, so oxygen is the limiting\nreagent. We can use the limiting reagent to calculate the yield:\n1 mol H2O\n(2 × 1.01 + 15.999) g H2O\n8.88 g O2 ×\n×\n= 158.8 g H2O\n1 mol O2\n1 mol H2O\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu/\n3.091 Introduction to Solid-State Chemistry\nFall 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The electromagnetic spectrum is shown here:\nRecall that the equality above came from the fact that frequency and wavelength are related through the\nspeed of light as c = λν. It's also important to remember that the energy of a photon is independent of the\namplitude of the wave:\nThe energy is set by the wavelength (or equivalently, frequency); the amplitude of the wave is related to its\nintensity: this can be thought of as the number of photons of a certain energy.\nExample:\nA radio station broadcasts at 100.7 MHz with a power output of 50 kW.

In 3.091, we'll use the Bohr model to model this process. In the Bohr model, an electron in a\nhydrogen atom can only live in discrete energy levels, which we label with n. The lowest energy level is the\nground state, with n = 1. The change in energy corresponding to the transition from an initial energy level,\nni to a final energy level, nf is given by\nΔE = -13.6\n-\n[eV ]\nn\nn\nf\ni\nIf a photon with just the right energy impinges on the atom, the photon can be absorbed and the electron\nexcited to a higher energy level.\nConversely, if an electron relaxes from a higher energy level to a lower one within the atom, a photon with\nfrequency ν = ΔE/h is released.\nExample:\nA power source emits 8 × 1018 photons/s at 10 W. Determine how much energy each pho\nton has.

We related the energy\nof a photon to its frequency and wavelength using the Planck-Einstein relation:\nhc\nE = hν = λ\nIn 3.091, the most common units we will use for energy are joules (J) or electron volts (eV). A joule is\nequivalent to a kg× m 2 , which is like a force integrated over a distance. Electron volts are also a unit of\ns\nenergy, but they are much smaller than a joule. An eV is literally the charge of one electron multiplied by\none volt! We can convert between joules and electron volts using\n1 eV = 1.6022 × 10-19 J\nDepending on the problem, it may be easier to work in J or eV. Either one works - double checking how\nyour units work out is a great way to check your answer.\nThe units of frequency (ν) are 1/s, or equivalently, Hertz (Hz), and the wavelength (λ) has units of m.\nNow, we can consider the speed of light, c. Last time, we said c = λν: using the units above, we see that\nthe speed has units m/s as it should!\nFrequently, we will use units like nanometers (nm) or microns (μm) for small length scales: these can\nbe converted to meters using the following conversion factors:\n1 nm = 10-9 m\n1 μm = 10-6 m\nThe last piece of the Planck-Einstein relation is the h: Planck's constant!

However, they do have angular momentum, and the shape of the probability\ncloud around the nucleus depends on the value of the angular momentum. The magnitude of the angular\nmomentum is related to the orbital angular momentum quantum number by\np\nL = h\nl(l + 1),\n0 ≤ l ≤ n - 1\nThe orbital angular momentum quantum numbers correspond directly to letters commonly used by chemists\nto describe the orbital subshells: for example, l = 1 corresponds to the s orbitals, which are spherical:\nImages of orbitals from B.

Each electron can either\nbe spin up or spin down. The magnitude of the spin is either +1/2 (spin up) or -1/2 (spin down). The\nmagnitude of the angular momentum associated with spin is\np\n|S| = h\ns(s + 1)\nand the spin projection onto the z-axis is given by\nSz = s h\nThe restriction on the allowed values of spin is\ns = ± 2\nExample: What is the electronic configuration of carbon? Write out the quantum numbers for each electron.\nCarbon has six valence electrons. We'll start filling up the quantum numbers by following the rules above.\nStarting with n = 1, the only possible value of l is l = 0, since 0 ≤ l ≤ n - 1. When l = 0, m must also be 0.\nThere are two possible spins that could go with these quantum numbers. There aren't any more available\nquantum numbers with n = 1, so we must go up to a higher shell. For n = 2, the lowest energy state\ncorresponds to the lowest magnitude of angular momentum, l = 0, which again requires m = 0.\nFor the last two electrons, we have to remember Hund's rule. Every orbital in a subshell must be singly\noccupied with electrons of one spin before adding electrons of the other. So the l = 1 electrons must have\ndifferent values of m, but the same value of ms.

It's important to recall Hund's rule: every orbital in a subshell must be\nsingly occupied before any orbital is doubly occupied.\n\n3.091: Introduction to Solid State Chemistry\nMaddie Sutula, Fall 2018\nRecitation 6\nExample: Draw the electronic configuration of Br and C in box notation.\nWe wrote the noble gas configuration above, so we can just give the box notation of the valence elec\ntrons here:\nFor carbon, the electronic configuration is 1s22s22p2 . In box notation, we fill up the 1s and 2s states, and\npopulate the 2p according to Hund's rule:\nPhotoelectron spectroscopy (PES)\nPhotoelectron spectroscopy (PES) is an experimental method used to determine electronic structure. First, a\nsample is bombarded with high energy photons to ionize the atoms. Then, the kinetic energy of the electrons\nthat are emitted is measured. The binding energy can be determined using\nEbinding = hν - KEe-\nBy plotting the relative counts of electrons emitted with various binding energies, the elemental composition\nof a sample can be determined using PES!\nExample: Determine which element corresponds to the following PES spectrum:\nOn this plot, the binding energy increases to the left. The electrons closer to the nucleus should have the\nhighest binding energy, so the left-most peak must correspond to the 1s electrons. The relative height of the\npeak corresponds to the relative frequency at which the electrons are emitted: since there are two 1s elec\ntrons, the height of the left-most peak must correspond to two electrons. The middle peak must correspond\nto two 2s electrons. Then, since the right-most peak is 1.5 times taller, it must represent 3 electrons in the\n2p subshell. The electronic configuration for the element in this PES diagram must be 1s22s22p3 , which\ncorresponds to nitrogen.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu/\n3.091 Introduction to Solid-State Chemistry\nFall 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "3.091: Introduction to Solid State Chemistry\nMaddie Sutula, Fall 2018\nRecitation 7\nPeriodic trends\nInside an atom, negatively-charged electrons are attracted to the positively-charged nucleus, but they repel\neach other. Electrons close to the nucleus can shield the outermost electrons from Coulomb forces between\nthe electrons and the nucleus.\nGoing across a row in the periodic table, each element has one extra electron and one extra proton. The\nadditional proton has a strong effect on the electrons, as the number of inner shielding electrons does not\nchange. However, when going down a period, there are more and more shells of electrons with increasing\nenergy and average radius from the nucleus. Therefore, atomic radius decreases from left to right across the\nrows of the periodic table, and increases from top to bottom.\nWhen atoms become ionized, their atomic radius changes as the charge state balance changes. If an atom\ngains electrons to become negatively charged, it is called an anion. If an atom loses electrons to become\npositively charged, it is called a cation. Cations are typically smaller than the neutral version of the atom,\nwhile anions are typically larger. An ionic solid contains cations and anions in a ratio that maintains charge\nneutrality.\nExample: Arrange Al, C, and Si in order of increasing atomic radius.\nCarbon is in the second period of the periodic table, while Al and Si are in the third: C must be the\nsmallest. Al is in group III, while Si is in group IV, so Al is likely larger than Si due to relatively strong\neffect of the extra proton Si has.\n(smallest)\nC → Si → Al\n(largest)\nLewis Dot Diagrams\nLewis dot diagrams are a tool used to visualize the valence electrons in atoms. Then, by pairing up electrons,\nwe can visualize possible ways that bonds can be formed between two atoms.\nThere are a couple of rules of thumb that come in handy when drawing Lewis dot diagrams. The octet\nrule tells us that atoms gain, lose, or share electrons in order to have a full valence shell of 8 electrons (2\nfor H and He). Also, the number of valence electrons in an atom is equal to the group number. We can\ngenerally start by following these steps:\n1. Determine the number of valence electrons in each atom in the compound\n2. Place a bonding pair between adjacent atoms\n3. Starting from terminal atoms, add electrons to form octets\nExample: Draw Lewis dot diagrams for the following compounds: CH4, CCl4, CO2, and OH-\nCH4: C has 4 valence electrons (group IV), while hydrogen just has one. Sharing four electrons between the\nC and H's yields an octet on the carbon atom and a complete shell of two electrons on the hydrogen. Note\nthat it's often convenient to put the atom that has the most unpaired electrons in the middle.\n\n3.091: Introduction to Solid State Chemistry\nMaddie Sutula, Fall 2018\nRecitation 7\nCCl4: Again, C has 4 valence electrons, and Cl has 7. Cl can only gain one additional electron to have\na full octet, so each Cl only makes one bond. Therefore, we can put C in the middle again and surround it\nwith Cl atoms, and every atom has a full octet.\nCO2: C has 4 valence electrons, while O has 6. We can start by placing the C in the middle and forming a\nbond with each O. The structure that results is unstable, because each O is left with an unpaired electron.\nC also has two unpaired electrons leftover. We can use them to form double bonds between the C and each\nO without violating the octet rule. Note that each O is left with two lone pairs.\nOH-: Here, the oxygen brings 6 valence electrons and the H brings just one, but there is an additional\nelectron in play because of the structure's overall negative charge. After forming a single bond between the\nO and the H, we're left with unpaired electrons, so we need to rearrange some more. We can't make a double\nbond to the hydrogen, as it can only support two electrons. Moving the extra electron to the oxygen to join\na lone pair does the trick.\nFormal charge\nAbove, we discussed the steps for constructing Lewis dot diagrams: by following these rules, we can determine\nstable electronic configurations of molecules. We can also quantify this stability by calculating the formal\ncharge.\n\nb\n-\nFormal Charge = # valence e s - N + 2\nwhere the number of valence electrons refers to the neutral atom in isolation, N = the number of nonbonding\nvalence electrons and b = the number of valence electrons participating in bonds. Formal charge should be\ncalculated for each atom in the molecule.\n\n3.091: Introduction to Solid State Chemistry\nMaddie Sutula, Fall 2018\nRecitation 7\nExample: Determine the formal charge of CO2.\nOxygen: the neutral oxygen atom in isolation has 6 valence electrons. Each oxygen in CO2 has 4 non-\nbonding electrons and 4 electrons stored in bonds.\nFormal Charge (Oxygen) = 6 - (4 + ) = 0\nCarbon: the neutral carbon atom in isolation has 4 valence electrons. Each carbon in CO2 has 8 electrons\nstored in bonds.\nFormal Charge (Carbon) = 4 - ( ) = 0\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu/\n3.091 Introduction to Solid-State Chemistry\nFall 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The existence of multiple\nelectronic configurations that are stable leads to resonance, which describes the delocalization of electrons\nin covalently bonded molecules. To be considered resonance structures, molecules must meet the following\ncriteria:\n1. Atoms must be in the same orientation relative to each other\n2. All resonance structures must have the same number of valence electrons\n3. The octet rule must be satisfied, with a few exceptions:\n- Not followed by some elements in periods three and higher, including Cl, Br, I, P, Si\n- Sulfur can have up to 12 e-\n-\n- Boron can have 6 e\n4. Formal charge should be on the most electronegative atoms\nExample: Draw resonance structures for ozone (O3) and CO2- .\nOzone consists of three oxygen atoms, for a total of 18 valence electrons. These can be equivalently dis\ntributed in two ways:\nCO2- consists of a central carbon atom which brings 4 valence electrons, and four oxygen atoms that each\nbring 6 electrons, and two additional electrons that yield the additional 2- charge. The resonance structures\ncan be represented as follows:\nThese equivalent structures can be combined into one compact picture (shown above on the right) that is\nan average of the possible structures. All of the resonance structures are equally likely, as they equivalently\nsatisfy the guidelines for stable Lewis structures.\n\n3.091: Introduction to Solid State Chemistry\nMaddie Sutula, Fall 2018\nRecitation 8\nFormal charge (again)\nIn the CO2- example above, the formal charge on each atom is shown in circles. The formal charge only\nappears on the oxygen, as oxygen is more electronegative than carbon. In the average structure, the formal\ncharge is averaged over all of the oxygen atoms. We can check that we have the most stable resonance\nstructure by evaluating the formal charge on various options. The resonance structure with the lowest\nformal charge on each atom is the most stable and will occur with higher probability over other resonance\nstructures. As a reminder, formal charge is calculated using\n\nb\n-\nFormal Charge = # valence e s - N + 2\nwhere the number of valence electrons refers to the neutral atom in isolation, N = the number of nonbonding\nvalence electrons and b = the number of valence electrons participating in bonds. Formal charge should be\ncalculated for each atom in the molecule.\nExample: Find three resonance structures of CO2, and determine which is the most stable.\nLast recitation, we drew one possible electronic structure of CO2. Two more are given here:\nThe formal charge on each atom in each of the three viable resonance structures is shown. Though each\nresonance structures satisfies the rules of valid Lewis dot diagrams and viable resonance structures, the\ncentral structure is the most stable as the formal charge is lowest.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu/\n3.091 Introduction to Solid-State Chemistry\nFall 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "3.091: Introduction to Solid State Chemistry\nMaddie Sutula, Fall 2018\nRecitation 10\nHybridization and atomic orbitals\nLewis dot diagrams and VSEPR are powerful tools to think about electronic configuration and molecular\nshape, but neither tool offers a way to predict bond stability. The strength of a covalent bond is proportional\nto the amount of overlap between electronic orbitals.\nConsider BeH2: beryllium contributes 2 valence electrons, and each of the two hydrogen atoms contribute\none valence electron.\nAs a reminder, the electronic configuration of hydrogen is 1s1 , while the electronic configuration of beryllium\nis 1s22s2 . The valence shell of Be (2s2) is full: it has two electrons, the maximum that can live in an s-orbital.\nThere aren't any singly-occupied orbitals available to form bonds with hydrogen, even though we predict\nfrom the Lewis dot diagram above that there should be single bonds between each H and the Be. We can\ndraw the electronic occupation of energy states in the Be atom as a function of energy, and then apply the\nprinciple of hybridization:\nenergy levels of Be atom\n→\npromotion\n→\nsp hybridization\nTo get around the issue of the full 2s shell, an electron could be promoted to the 2s subshell, leaving\ntwo electrons that are ready to form bonds. However, the 2s and 2p electrons aren't equal: if this were\nthe case, the two H-Be bonds would be unequal, which has no physical basis. Instead, consider the third\npicture: by combining the 2s orbital with one of the 2p subshells, an intermediate sp-hybridized energy level\nis created. This sp orbital has two equal-energy subshells that allow for two equal energy bonds to be formed\nwith the Be atom. This is not unique to BeH2: sp hybridization occurs any time a 2p subshell combines with\nthe 2s subshell. Further, if there are more electrons available to participate in bonding, sp2 hybridization (3\nequal bonds), sp3 hybridization (4 equal bonds), or higher order hybridization involving d-orbitals can take\nplace.\nHybridization directly correlates to molecular geometry! The following table shows the equivalence:\n\n3.091: Introduction to Solid State Chemistry\nMaddie Sutula, Fall 2018\nRecitation 10\nMolecular geometry\nlinear\ntrigonal\ntetrahedral\ntrigonal bipyramidal\noctahedral\nHybridization\nsp\nsp\nsp\nsp3d\n3d2\nsp\nMolecular orbital (MO) theory\nWe can use molecular orbital theory to gain a better understanding of how electrons form bonds and to\npredict properties such as bond stability and magnetic character. In 3.091, we'll apply MO theory to dimers.\nRecall that all electrons are negatively charged: in free space, electrons would feel a repulsive force from\nother nearby electrons. However, there are additional forces within an atom that create an environment that\nallows for the concentration of electron density into bonds. When considering how two electrons in a solid\nmay interact, it is useful to think about wave nature of electrons. Two electrons can constructively interfere\nto form a bonding MO, or destructively interfere to form an antibonding MO.\nMO diagrams are a convenient tool to keep track of the bonding and antibonding orbitals, and therefore the\nbond strength. We can quantify the bond strength by calculating bond order:\n\nBond order =\n# electrons in bonding orbitals - # electrons in antibonding orbitals\nIf the bond order is greater then zero, a stable dimer forms.\nIf a dimer has any unpaired electrons, it is paramagnetic: these unpaired electrons align with applied\nmagnetic fields and are weakly attracted to the applied field. If all the electrons are paired, the dimers are\nrepelled by applied magnetic fields, and the dimers are called diamagnetic.\nExample: Draw a molecular orbital diagram for the F2 dimer. Calculate the bond order, and deter\nmine whether it is paramagnetic or diamagnetic.\n\n3.091: Introduction to Solid State Chemistry\nMaddie Sutula, Fall 2018\nRecitation 10\nWe start here by drawing the AO diagrams of the valence electrons of each F involved in the F2 dimer. Recall\nthat F (Group VII) has 7 valence electrons. Then, we populate the σ bonding and σ∗ antibonding orbitals\nassociated with the 2s valence shell. Then, we draw the 2p σ bonding, π bonding, π∗ antibonding, and σ∗\nantibonding orbitals. Populating from the lowest energy to the highest energy, there are enough electrons\nto fill the 2p π∗ antibonding orbitals.\nWe can calculate the bond order using the formula from above. There are eight electrons in bonding\norbitals and six electrons in antibonding orbitals:\nbond order = (8 - 6) = 1\nAll of the electrons are paired, so the F2 dimer is diamagnetic.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu/\n3.091 Introduction to Solid-State Chemistry\nFall 2018\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
