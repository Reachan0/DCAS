It covers energy conversion and power flow in both macroscopic and quantum-scale electrical and electromechanical systems, including electric motors and generators, electric circuit elements, quantum tunneling structures and instruments. It studies photons as waves and particles and their interaction with matter in optoelectronic devices, including solar cells, displays, and lasers.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nThe formal prerequisites are 8.02 or\n6.01\n. Students concurrently enrolled in 6.02 or\n6.002\nmay find that 6.007 complements those courses.\n\nStudents were asked to answer the following questions at the beginning of the course:\n\nWhat electromagnetism experience do you have (8.02/\n8.022\n, research, etc.)?\n\nWhat quantum physics experience do you have (\n8.04\n/\n5.73\n, research, etc.)?\n\nWrite down Maxwell's Equations (differential or integral form).\n\nSuggested Texts\n\nFrench, Anthony, and Edwin Taylor.\nAn Introduction to Quantum Physics\n. W. W. Norton, 1978. ISBN: 9780393091069.\n\nShen, Liang, and Jin Au Kong.\nApplied Electromagnetism\n. 3rd ed. CL Engineering, 1995. ISBN: 9780534947224.\n\nProblem Sets\n\nProblem sets will be graded on a scale of 0 to 100 points. You should submit your own work. Problem sets are an important part of your learning experience, and you are strongly encouraged to put time into them.\n\nProblem sets will be posted most Wednesdays and are due at the beginning of lecture on the following Wednesday.\n\nLabs\n\nWe have reserved 3 hours for each lab, although each lab should take no more than 2 hours. Labs will be completed in groups of 3 assigned by the course staff.\n\nSome labs require pre-lab exercises which you have to complete prior to attending the lab. During the lab you will be asked to record measurements, observations, and graphs of data taken during the in-lab exercises. Additional post-lab exercises and write-ups must be turned in for grading on the Friday following the lab. The labs will be scored on the scale of 0 to 10.\n\nExams\n\nThe exams are closed book, although you may bring an equation sheet. Calculators are neither needed nor allowed.\n\nGrades\n\nYour final grade will be determined by a weighted average as follows:\n\nACTIVITIES\n\nPERCENTAGES\n\n5 labs\n\n10%\n\n10 problem sets\n\n20%\n\n2 midterms\n\n40%\n\nFinal exam\n\n30%\n\nAn additional 5% can be earned by completing the extra credit lab.\n\nFailure to attempt all five labs will lower your final grade by one letter. We will drop your lowest problem set grade (only the top nine will count).\n\nCollaboration\n\nWe fully recognize the potential value of students working or studying together, and we do not have any objection to this kind of cooperation, so long as all participants are involved in all aspects of the work, not with each doing only a fraction of the assignment. In particular, when you hand in a paper with your name on it, we assume that you are certifying that the details presented are entirely your own work and that you played a substantial role at the conception stage.",

In completing the brief prob\nlems below, you should review your notes from 18.02 and 18.03 to prepare for applying your\nmathematical prowess in these areas later in class.\n(i) Trigonometry and complex numbers.

Assume the voltage drop across the LED is small compared with the\nvoltage drop across the resistor.\nProblem 10.2 - Energy Bands and Optoelectronic Devices\nEnergy band diagrams of two different semiconductors are drawn below, each as undoped, p-type doped, or\nn-type doped semiconductor.\nEnergy band diagrams of two semicondu\nctors, shown as undoped, p-type doped, or\nn-type do\nped.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\n6.007 Spring 2011\nProblem Set 10\n(a) Label each semiconductor as undoped, p-type doped, or n-type doped.\n(b) Using the semiconductors from part (a) you are asked to design a light emitting device that emits red\ncolor.

Pay attention to the polarity of the battery attached below.\n\n6.007 Spring 2011\nProblem Set 10\nProblem 10.3 -Flash Memory\nFlash memory stores information by changing the charge on a floating gate (a piece of metal that is not\ncontacted to other conductors). We interpret a floating gate with a positive charge as a 1 and a floating\ngate with a negative charge as a 0. The details by which the flash memory is read (e.g. how we detect the\npresence of a positive or negative charge) is a topic best left to 6.012. A one sentence explanation is: when\nthere is a positive charge on the floating gate, current can flow from the source to the drain and we read a\n1; when there is negative charge on the gate, current cannot flow and we read a 0.\nThe figure below shows the floating gate flash memory structure. The dielectric constant of SiO2 is 3Eo. The\nthickness of the oxide between the substrate and the floating gate is 10 nm and the thickness of the oxide\nbetween the control gate and floating gate is 45 nm. The floating gate is 10 nm thick.\nThe interesting part (that you won't learn in 6.012) is how we change the charge on the floating gate. To\nwrite a bit, we must somehow put electrons on or take electrons off of the isolated bit of metal. The write\noperation is accomplished through electron tunneling and is explored below.\nTo begin, let's assume that we have already written information to our memory and charge is stored on\nthe floating gate. Let's further assume that we have an excess of electrons on the floating gate (thus the\nbit represented is 0). We are interested in how long the bit will remain a 0. We know that the electrons\nwill eventually tunnel through the oxide, depleting the charge on the gate. When the charge on the gate\napproaches zero (neutral), we will no longer sure of the value of the bit.\nIf a single free electron is present in the floating gate, it will see the potential barrier shown below. The\n3.2 eV potential barrier represents the energy difference between the conduction band of metal versus the\nconduction band SiO2 (an insulator). The electron has an energy given by E = kbT/2 where T is the\ntemperature in Kelvin and kb is the Boltzmann constant.\n45nm\nSiO2\nSiO2\nFG\nSubstrate\nCG\n3.2eV\n0eV\n(a) What is the energy of the electron at room temperature, T = 300 K? What is its speed in the classical\npicture? The effective mass of the electron in the floating gate is m ∗\ne = 0.26me.\n(b) Estimate the energy level n of the electron using the energy level spacings of the infinite potential well,\nEn = 12π2n2/(2mL2).\nTwo\ndia\ngra\nms o\nf the float\ning ga\nte fl\nash me\nmory stru\ncture.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\n6.007 Spring 2011\nProblem Set 10\n(c) What is the transmission probability T that the electron will tunnel through thick dielectric? What is\nT for the thin dielectric? Recall from lecture that T is\n4Eo(V - Eo) -2κL\nT ≈\ne\nV 2\nwith\n2m(V - Eo)\nκ2 =\nwhere L is the width of the potential, V is the height of the potential above zero, and Eo is the energy\nof the particle above zero. Due to defects in the silicon dioxide layer between the floating gate and\nsubstrate, the effective width of the barrier is reduced to L = 4.8 nm.\n(d) Assume the classical picture of the electron rattling in the box. (This is especially valid if your n from\n(b) is much larger than 1.) In this view the electron moves with a classical speed, bouncing back and\nforth between the walls of the box. How frequently (in Hertz) does it \"hit\" the thin potential barrier?\n(e) Use your answers to (c) and (d) to find the half-life of the electron in the box. For how long will this\nmemory cell store data?\n(f) To write a flash memory bit, we apply a 13 V potential across the floating gate as shown in the right\nfigure. (The source, drain, and substrate electrodes are grounded, while the control gate is biased at\n13 V.)\nSketch the magnitude of the electric field across the structure. Assume that the gates and substrate\nare metals (hence the electric field inside of them is zero). It may help to visualize the structure as\ncapacitors in the following manner:\n(g) What is the potential drop (in volts) across the thick dielectric? What is the potential drop across the\nthin dielectric?\n(h) Use your answer to (g) to sketch the potential well that will be experienced by an electron incident\nfrom the substrate. [This will be a modified form of the original potential because now there is a\nvoltage. It may help to look at the lab handout.] Sketch the ground state wave function that would\nbe a solution to the Schr odinger equation for this potential for an electron incident from the substrate.\nFinally sketch the probability distribution associated with the wavefunction.\n\n6.007 Spring 2011\nProblem Set 10\nProblem 10.4 - Working with Wave Functions\n(a) The time-independent wavefunction of the infinite square-well potential's second excited state is shown\nin the figure below.\nThe time-independent wavefunction has the form:\nψ3(x) = Asin(k3x)\n(i) Find k3 and A in terms of the other variables given.\n(ii) Show that for this wavefunction (x) = 3L.\n(iii) Find (E) for this wavefunction, which we'll refer to as E3. What is the full wavefunction, including\ntime dependence, Ψ3(x, t)? Is this a stationary state?\n(b) Out of the first three lowest energy states, which ones correspond to wavefunctions that are even, and\nwhich ones correspond to wavefunctions that are odd? Given that a system only absorbs light when a\ntransition occurs between an even state and an odd state, at which two wavelengths would you expect\nto see absorption peaks if you were to shine light on this system? You may leave answers in terms of\nE1, E2 and E3.\nProblem 10.5 - Quantum superposition\nSo far, we have limited our quantum mechanical analysis to time-independent solutions of Schrodinger's\nEquation. However, in mixed states, or states which contain more than one eigenstate, the total solution\nmay contain time-dependence which is physcially meaningful. Let us examine this in the context of the\ninifite square well.\n(a) Consider the ground state and first excited state of the infinite square well of width L.\nr\nπ\nψ1(x) =\nsin( x)\nr\nL\nL\n\n2π\nψ2(x) =\nsin(\n)\nL\nLx\n\nr\nr\n6.007 Spring 2011\nProblem Set 10\nThe complete solutions of these two eigenstates are\nπ\nj(E1/~)t\nΨ1(x) =\nsin( x)e\nL\nL\n2π\nj(E2 /~)t\nΨ2(x) =\nsin(\nx)e\nL\nL\nWhat are the energies E1, E2 and oscillation frequencies ω1, ω2 of each state, respectively? Leave\nanswers in terms of m, 1 and L.\n(b) What are the probability distributions |Ψ1(x)|2 and |Ψ2(x)|2? Are these time-dependent?\n(d) For L=5, sketch or plot the probability distribution in part (c) for three different times t =\n(c) What is the probability distribution of the mixed state Ψ =\n√ Ψ1(x) +\n√ Ψ2(x)?\nIs this time-\ndependent, and what is the period?\nπ\n,\nω1-ω2\nπ\nt = 0, and t = -\nYou do not have to be exact but give a correct interpretation of how the wave\nω1-ω2\npacket evolves. In the particle picture, what is the semiclassical interpretation for how the particle is\nbehaving?\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n6.007 Electromagnetic Energy: From Motors to Lasers\nSpring 2011\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

You can think of the Field Emission Display as an array of tiny single color\nCathode Ray Tubes (CRTs), with each CRT corresponding to one subpixel in the total display\n(with a red, a blue, and two green subpixels forming one pixel). At each of the subpixels there is a\nsource of electrons at some electric potential and a grounded phosphor screen. To turn a subpixel\non we need to raise the electric field at the source until we begin emitting electrons. This happens\nwhen the electric field reaches roughly 109 [V/m]. The emitted electrons then accelerate toward\nthe screen, causing the screen to glow when they hit.\nFigure 1: Left: Image from 'A new era: Nanotube displays' (Nature Photonics), Right: Our\napproximation of a single subpixel\nWe can model the electron source of a single pixel in the Field Emission Display as a charged\nconducting sphere and a ground plane at infinity.\n(a) For a spherical conductor with total charge Q what is the surface electric field magnitude as\na function of the sphere's radius R?\n(b) What is the total charge Q needed on a conducting sphere with radius R for the sphere to\nhave potential V relative to a ground plane at infinity?\n(c) At what radius is the surface electric field magnitude equal to 108 [V/m] for a charged spherical\nconductor at potential V = -6 [volts]?\n(d) For the conducting sphere in part (c) what are the total charge Q and the surface charge\ndensity qs?\nReprinted by permission from Macmillan Publishers Ltd:\nDean, Kenneth. \"A New Era: Nanotube Displays.\"\nNature Photonics 1: 273-275, copyright 2007.\n\n6.007 Spring 2011\nProblem Set 2: Energy and Static Fields\nProblem 2.2 - Short Problem on Magnetostatics\nBelow is a picture of a circuit consisting of a current source I connected to two conducting rails,\nseparated by the dimension W. A conducting bar makes good electrical contact with those rails\nand can slide in the horizontal direction. The system is immersed in a magnetic field that goes into\nthe paper as shown.

The inner and outer strands are\nperfectly conducting.\na\nb\nd\n(a) We will first consider the case of a capacitive setup for the coaxial cable. That is, the inner\nand outer strands of the cable are isolated. Assume that charge densities +ρ C and -ρ C\nm\nm\nare present on the inner and outer strands, respectively. What is the capacitance per unit\nlength, C, of the cable in terms of the given parameters? The SI unit for capacitance is the\nfarad, F . Show that your units are correct.\n(b) Next, consider the case of an inductive setup for the coaxial cable. That is, the inner and\nouter strands of the cable are shunted at each end of the cable. Assume that current densities\nof +I A and -I A are present on the inner and outer strands, respectively (with the current\n\n6.007 Spring 2011\nProblem Set 2: Energy and Static Fields\ngoing into the paper).

Show that your units are\ncorrect.\n√1\n(c) Compute the value of\n. What are the units? Where have you seen this value previously?\nLC\nProblem 2.4 - Electrons in Metal1\nIn 1917 Tolman and Stewart published a paper titled \"The electromotive force produced by the\nacceleration of metals\" [Physics Review 8, pages 97-116] in which they demonstrated that mobile\ncharge carriers in metals are electrons, which was not known for certain before their experiment.\nBelow we will consider a simple version of their experiment.\nSuppose we accelerate a metal bar, which means that we accelerate the atomic cores, which are\nbound to each other. On average, the mobile electrons do not feel any forces, as the mutual repulsion\nby the mobile electrons is effectively canceled by the attraction to the atomic cores. As the bar and\nthe atomic cores are accelerated, the mobile electrons are left behind, As a result, they pile up at\nthe trailing end of the bar (they cannot easily leave the bar). This polarizes the bar, with negative\nin the opposite direction of acceleration.\nE\nThe surface charges produce an electric field\ncharge on the trailing surface and positive charge (deficiency of electrons) on the leading surface.\n\nNow let us take a metal bar of lenght L = 0.1 m and cross-sectional area A = 0.0001 m2 and\naccelerate it horizontally with acceleration a= 10 m/s2, as in the picture.\n(1) We know that the mass of the electron is 9 x 10-31kg and the electron charge is 1.6 x 10-19C.\nAssume a steady state condition is achieved very quickly. What is the voltage measured by a\nvoltmeter attched to the end of the metal bar (assume the voltmeter does not interfere with\nthe experiment, therefore it has negligible weight and infinite resistance)? Note: In steady\nstate, the force due to acceleration has to match the electrostatic force.\n(2) If instead of the voltmeter, a lightbulb of 100 Ω internal resistance is attached across the ends\nof the bar, what is the current that would be measured through the lightbulb?\n1This problem was adopted from Chabay & Sherwood, Matter and Interactions II\n\n6.007 Spring 2011\nProblem Set 2: Energy and Static Fields\nProblem 2.5 - Have You Ever Looked Inside a 9 V Battery?\nIf you took the casing off a 9 V battery (manufacturers strongly caution against disassembly of the\nbattery, and 6.007 staff strongly agrees) this is what you would see:\n\n(1) Make a guess as to what the cylinders in the picture on the right represent, how many of\nthem there are and how do they contribute to the 9 V operation of the battery?\n(2) The battery capacity of the 9 V is rated at 600 mA - hr. How many moles of charge are\nstored in the battery?\n(3) Dimensions of the 9 V batttery is 45 mm x 25 mm x 15 mm. You are asked to make a\ncapacitor that occupies the equivalent volume, with plates of the capacitor separated by an\nair gap of 0.1 um, and folded to occupy the entire volume.\n- What is the capacitance of such a capacitor?\n- How many moles of charge would you be able to store in such a capacitor when it is\ncharged to 9 V? Compare this stored charge to the value to the stored charge you found\nin question 2 above.\n- What is the electric field between the capacitor plates when it is fully charged? If the\nelectric field is larger than the air breakdown field, explain what will happen when the\ncapacitor is charged. Will it undergo an electrical breakdown?\n(4) Now let's do some cost analysis:\n- Given that you would spend $ 3 to buy the 9 V battery, what is the cost per kW-hr of\nelectrical energy produced by the battery. [Note: 1 kW-hr of electrical energy from the\nelectrical grid costs $ 0.15].\n- A gallon of gasoline stores 40 kW-hr of energy and cost $ 3 per gallon.

While it is said to be a 'cartoon' view, this is\nactually not a bad picture of a cross-section of the machine. It consists of a perhaps oddly shaped magnetic\ncircuit on the outside with a 'Yoke' and 'Poles' made of ferromagnetic material with μ >> μ0, and a rotor,\nalso made of ferromagnetic material. There are conductors wound in slots in that rotor. In this problem, we\nare going to do a very quick analysis of this motor.\nΩ\nStator Yoke\nField Poles\nField Winding\nArmature Winding\nRotor\nFigure 4.1.1: Cartoon View of a DC motor\n(a) First, note that because of the ferromagnetic parts of the machine, an Ampere's Law loop that goes\nvertically through the machine from the bottom pole, the rotor and the top pole and then around\nthrough the outer yoke is in ferromagnetic material everywhere but in the two air-gaps, which have\nradial dimension g. Assuming that the field winding wrapped around each pole has Nf turns and that\ncurrent in that field winding is carrying current If , find the magnetic flux density Br crossing the\nair-gaps. What is the SIGN of the radial magnetic flux in the two gaps?\n(b) Now, assume that there are Na turns in the armature (this is the rotor in a DC machine). That is,\ncurrent into the rotor passes through wires in the rotor slots Na times under each pole. In this view,\ncurrent is coming out of the paper under the top pole and going into the paper under the bottom\npole (well, over, but we use the term 'under the pole' in this context). Using the Lorentz Force Law,\ncalculate the torque produced by current Ia in the armature.\n(c) Note the magic in this motor is produced by the commutator, which is continually switching the wires\nso that the armature current is always in the locations shown in Figure 4.1.1. However, the rotor\nmay be turning so the wires are moving with respect to the poles. Now, consider one turn of wire\nthat comes out of the paper on one side of the motor and goes back in exactly 180* away on the\nother side. As the rotor turns the flux linked by that turn changes, resulting in a voltage. Estimate\nthat voltage for the time when that turn of wire is 'under' the poles, as a function of rotor radius\nR, axial length L (the dimension into the paper), magnetic flux density Br and rotational speed Ω.\nRemember that the commutator, as it is re-connecting the wires to make current stay under the poles,\n1From Electric Power Principlesby J.L. Kirtley, Wiley, 2010\n\n6.007 Spring 2011\nProblem Set 4: Forces and Magnetic Fields\nis also rectifying the voltage produced so it always has the same sign. All of the wires under the pole\nremain connected in series with each other. You should be able to conclude that Figure 4.1.2 shows an\nadequate representation for the motor, where the armature resistance Ra is the resistance of the coils\nof wire in the rotor, in series, plus some additional resistance for the brushes, etc. What is the motor\ncoefficient G, in terms of the number of armature terms, the number of field turns, motor radius and\nlength and air-gap?\n-\nf\nRa\nG I\nΩ\nVa\n+\nFigure 4.1.2: Equivalent Circuit of a DC motor\n(d) You should be able to use the first law of thermodynamics to conclude that your expressions for internal\nvoltage Ea = GΩIf and torque produced T = GIaIf . That is, power into the internal voltage source\nis the same as mechanical power out.\n(e) Now, assume the machine is connected to a voltage source with value Va. Calculate, as a function of\nmotor rotational speed Ω, power into the electrical terminals and mechanical power out of the shaft.\nFor high speeds, both of these quantities are negative. What does that mean?\nProblem 4.2 -Energy Method\n(a) Consider a solenoid with a partially inserted core of magnetic permeability μ, shown in Figure 4.2.\nThe solenoid has a total of N turns, height h and cross sectional area A.\nto a power supply sometime in the past, but now the two ends of the coil form a short.\nx\nN turns\nh\nμ\nThe solenoid was attached\nFigure 4.2 Solenoid with partially inserted core\n∂\nFind an expression for the force on the magnetic core fc by taking a derivative\nof the stored magnetic\n∂x\nenergy, and indicate its direction. (Which expression should you use for the stored magnetic energy?)\nAssume that μ » μo such that only the part containing the magnetic core has significant inductance.\nIgnore gravity for this problem.\n(b) Can you solve this problem by using the other expression for stored magnetic energy? Why or why\nnot?\n\n6.007 Spring 2011\nProblem Set 4: Forces and Magnetic Fields\nProblem 4.3 - Junkyard Magnet\nShown in Figure 4.3 a) is a lifting electromagnet similar to what is seen in junkyards. It uses magnetic\nfields to pick up large pieces of steel, including automobiles. As described in Figure 4.1 b), the magnetic is\ncylindrical, with a coil of N=1,000 turns contained inside a ferromagnetic material. The radius of the coils is\nr1 = 0.5 m. The other radius of the ferromagnetic material is r2 = 0.8 m, assuming the coils themselves have\nnegligible thickness. The car (modeled as a slab) and the junkyard magnet both are made with materials\nwith very high permeabilities. The gap between the magnet and the car is assumed to be uniform with value\ng.\nx\nx\nx\nx\nx\ng\nr1\nr2\n1,000\nturns\na)\nb)\nFigure 4.3 Junkyard magnet a) Cross section. b) 3D view\n(a) Sketch what the magnetic field lines should look like.\nDraw a magnetic circuit for this situation,\nindicating which elements of the magnetic circuit correspond with which elements or features of the\nphysical device.\n(b) Find the reluctance of each element in your magnetic circuit, assuming magnetic permeability is very\nlarge for the magnetic material and the car. Compute the inductance of the magnetic as a function of\nthe gap dimension g.\n(c) Compute the force exerted on the car if the current in the coil is 25 Amperes, as a function of the gap\ndimension g.\n(d) Your answer in part (c) should yield an unreasonable answer for small values of the gap. Why?\n(e) To get a more reasonable answer, find the value of magnetic flux density in the gap as a function of\ncurrent in the coil and the gap g. Suppose the system 'saturates' when the magnetic flux density\nreaches B = 1.8 T.\n(f) Using this result, sketch your best estimate of the actual force as a function of gap for 0 < g < 10 cm.\nIn doing this, you should assume that magnetic flux goes 'straight across the gap' and that there is no\nmeaningful fringing.\n\n6.007 Spring 2011\nProblem Set 4: Forces and Magnetic Fields\nProblem 4.4 -- Variable Reluctance Machine\nThis problem tests knowledge of Magnetic Circuits and Motors.\nThe variable reluctance machine(VRM) is the simplest AC motor. This VRM consists of a wire with N turns\nwrapped around a magnet core(with magnetic permeability μ >> μ0) that delivers magnetic flux to a gap.\nWithin the gap is a rotating bar or rotor.\nv\n+\n-\ni\nv\n+\n-\ni\n(a) t = t1\n(b) t = t2\nThe spinning rotor has length l, width a and a cross sectional area of A. At closest approach, the gap g(t)\nbetween the rotor and stator is gmin when the rotor is aligned and as large as gmax when the rotor is out of\nalignment.\n(a) Draw a magnetic circuit for this system. Label which physical portion corresponds to the various\nreluctances. Determine the reluctance for the gap (Rgap) and the rotor (Rrotor) in terms of the\ngeometric and material parameters discussed above.\n(b) Determine the maximum and minimum magnetic flux φ within the gap between rotor and stator. Write\nyour answer in terms of reluctances.\n(c) Determine the total inductance L(Θ) of the motor for the two cases (aligned and unaligned) assuming\nthat gmin and gmax are known.\n(d) Now, assume you can approximate the inductance as a function of angle Θ to have a sinusoidal variation\nbetween maximum and minimum inductance. Sketch that inductance and write an expression for it.\n(e) When a constant current is applied, what is the expression for torque as a function of Θ?. You should\nsee that the torque switches sign for half the period, creating a restoring force that causes the motor to\noscillate. To keep the motor spinning in one direction., you can turn this into a 'synchronous' motor\nby driving it with a current that depends on rotor position What form of current would you use? Find\nthe time average torque produced by this machine when driven by your current waveform.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n6.007 Electromagnetic Energy: From Motors to Lasers\nSpring 2011\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

In their own\nwords--\n[. . . ] Air is slowly pumped through a small cylindrical cell with flat windows on both ends.\nInfrared light is transmitted through one window, through the cell, through the second window,\nand is measured by a detector that is sensitive to infrared radiation. In the atmosphere carbon\ndioxide absorbs infrared radiation, contributing to warming of the earth surface. Also in the\ncell CO2 absorbs infrared light. More CO2 in the cell causes more absorption, leaving less light\nto hit the detector. We turn the detector signal, which is registered in volts, into a measure of\nthe amount of CO2 in the cell through extensive and automated (always ongoing) calibration\nprocedures. 1\nIn this problem, you will use the Lorentz oscillator model to predict the peak absorption of atmospheric CO2\nby estimating its plasma frequency ωp, resonance frequency ω0, and linewidth γ.\n1. For a dilute gas (i.e., a medium with small susceptibility), show that,\n√\nri\nn =\nrr\nκ =\n.\n(1)\n2n\n2. Use the most recent (mean) CO2 concentration (300 ppm) measured at Mauna Loa and the Ideal Gas\n\nLaw to determine the number of CO2 molecules per unit volume m3. Assume temperature is 300 *K.\nEstimate the plasma frequency of this sample. What is an approximate index of refraction for a sample\nof this gas?\n3. Figure 1 shows the absorption spectrum of CO2 (taken from Lecture 20).

From this graph, determine the center frequency ω0 and linewidth γ (measured full\nwidth at half-maximum) of the CO2 absorption peak.\n1Mauna Loa has written about their measure procedure and mean measurements (since 1958!) at http://www.esrl.noaa.\ngov/gmd/ccgg/trends/co2_data_mlo.html.\n\n6.007 Spring 2011\nProblem Set 7\n4. What is the peak absorption coefficient at this absorption line? Compare this to the absorption line\nmeasured for 350ppm.\n5. If a 1mW beam at 10.6μm wavelength hits CO2, what is the output power after traveling 10m?\n6. Will the absorption coefficient measured in an experiment be smaller or larger than the calculated\nvalue? Why?\nProblem 7.2, Two Slit Spectrometer\nFollowing the results of the previous problem, you would like to make a measurement of the concentration of\nthe carbon dioxide in the air. To do this we would like to look at the absorption of the air across the range\nof wavelengths carbon dioxide has some absorption. You could try measuring the absorption at individual\nwavelengths with discrete detectors and sources, but it would be faster if you could make one measurement\nat several wavelengths at the same time. To make the measurement in one shot you use something called\na spectrometer. In this problem we will look at a spectrometer based on the two slit grating discussed in\nclass.\n\n(a) Using theory from the two slit interference pattern shown in class, find the angle of the first offaxis\ninterference maximum (first order fringe) as a function of slit distance and wavelength. Assume the\nwidth of the slits is negligible.\n(b) If we are interested in the wavelength region from 9 - 11μm how far away from the slits would we\nneed to place our camera so that this wavelength band is spread over 1 cm. Assume that the slits are\nseparated by d = 50μm and that we want the 10μm wavelength to occur in the center of the pattern.\n(c) How does the interference pattern change as we increase the number of slits?\nTo answer this question you can use the applet at:\nhttp://physics.neiu.edu/vpl/optics/diffraction.html.\nFor the applet, set the slit width to 0.1 (small enough that the slits are approximately point sources)\nand wavelength to 10.\n(d) A CCD camera is placed 1 m away from the slits. The pixel size is 20 microns, what is the wavelength\nresolution of this CCD+slit spectrometer if the fringes were infinitely sharp? Again assume a slit\nseparation of d = 50μm and that the 10 μm fringe is at the middle of the CCD.\n\n6.007 Spring 2011\nProblem Set 7\nProblem 7.3\nPlane waves from the same source can form an interference pattern (subject to some conditions we'll ignore\nhere). In practice that means that when waves reflect from boundaries a standing wave pattern can be\nformed on the side of the boundary containing the incident and reflected waves.\nThe figures on the next page indicate the standing wave patterns resulting when an incident wave in medium\n1 with amplitude equal to 1 V/m is incident on an interface. Label the graphs (a)-(d) to match them with\nthe description detailed below.

The basic idea is to split a beam of light\ninto two beams (which are initially in phase), and send each through an identical path length, and then\nrecombine them (see the figure). If the two beams at the output are in phase, then they will constructively\ninterfere, and the signal observed, Iout,\nIf they destructively interfere, then Iout will be\nminimized.\nProblem 7.4 Mach-Zehnder Interferometer\nis maximized.\nE1\nE2\nE3\nE4\nE5\nE5\nAssume the refractive index of the air is 1, and the refractive index of the water is 1.33. The refractive index\nof water is increased by 0.002 for each gram of sugar added to water.\n(a) First assume one beam (solid line) passes through nothing but air, but the second beam (dotted line)\npasses through a container of a sugar solution in water. Assume that containers are made of optically\ntransparent materials and the thickness of the container is d. thick containers. Write expressions for\nthe electric fields E1 through E5 at the points indicated on the graph. Answers can be left in terms of\nthe index of the solution ns\nNow find the intensity Iout How does the intensity\n(b) Assume the thickness of the container is 1 cm and the wavelength is 633 nm. How much sugar must\nequal to zero? Where do you think the energy goes in this\ncase?\n(c) Now assume you have an identical container of 1 cm thickness in the first beam but it's filled with\nwater. How much sugar must be added to the solution in the container in the sensing arm to minimize\nIout now? Explain the difference in the sensitivity of the Mach-Zehnder in these two cases.\nand the wavevector k.\nchange as the solution concentration increases?\nbe added to the solution to make the Iout\nE1\nE2\nE3\nE4\nE5\nE5\n(d) Consider using this device as a sensor for refractive index, and the only signal you have is an intensity\nreadout from a power meter placed at the output. You first take a calibration with a solution that has\n\n6.007 Spring 2011\nProblem Set 7\na known amount of sugar dissolved. Then, your friend adds some sugar to the starting solution and\nyou are allowed to measure again the output intensity with this solution placed in the Mach-Zehnder\nsensor. Assuming the change in index between this and the reference solution is small, what is the\nconcentration that you would choose to start with? This is called biasing the Mach-Zehnder\n(e) Consider the same sensing configuration as part (d) but the first semitransparent mirror is not perfect\nand splits the light beams in a ratio of 40:60 instead of 50:50, with less intensity passing through the\ncontainer with sugar. What are the expressions now for the E fields and of Iout? With the same\nbiasing condition as before, does this increase or decrease your sensitivity?\n(f) Now you have the choice of using either a light source of 633 nm or 800 nm to perform the intensity\nmeasurements described above. Which wavelength would you use to have the best sensitivity?\nProblem 7.5 Rainbows\nA very narrow beam of unpolarized red light of intensity Io is incident (at A) on a spherical water drop (see\nfigure above). At A, some of the light is reflected and some enters the water drop. The refracted light reaches\nthe surface of the drop at B where some of the light is reflected back into the water, and some emerges into\nthe air. The light that is reflected back into the water reaches the surface of the drop at C where some of\nthe light is reflected back into the drop, and some emerges into the air. The index of refraction of water for\nthe red light is nred =1.331.\n(a) Using the data form the figure, what is the angle α? (You can leave this answer in the form of an\nexpression.)\n(b) What is the intensity of light that refracts into the drop at A? (Take into account both TE and TM\npolarized light.)\n(c) For what value of angle would you find that the light reflected at A is entirely TE polarized ? (You can\nleave this answer in the form of an expression.)\n(d) What is the dominant polarization of light that emerges at B? Explain.\n\n6.007 Spring 2011\nProblem Set 7\n(e) For blue light, the index of refraction in water is 1.343. The speed of blue light in water is therefore about\n1% slower than that of red light. In the figure above, showing the red-light path, assume that the incoming\nnarrow beam of light also contains blue-light and draw the trajectory that the blue-light beam would take\nafter it enters the water droplet at A.\n(f) If you look at the rainbow in the sky you will notice that the blue band of color is closest to the ground\nand the red color band is highest up.

For example, given\na complex number x, the magnitude |x| is abs(x).\n- Likewise, to find the phase of a complex number in MATLAB, use the function angle().\n- And one general note, MATLAB is built around vectors, and as you may recall, vector multiplication\nis not element by element but rather row by column. Here, we're interested in element by element\noperations since we just want to evaluate an equation (e.g., for the relative dielectric constant given by\nthe Lorentz model equation) at a set of points. So if we have a vector omega with all of our frequencies,\nto square each frequency you use omega.^2. The \".\" means to do each element separately. Similarly,\nto get the free space wavelength corresponding to those ω, we would do lambda=2*pi*3*10^8./omega,\nwhich would give us the vector lambda with our wavelengths in meters.

Figure 1 shows a schematic of the\nphysical setup of frustrated internal reflection, where light which would be reflected internally inside a glass\nwaveguide is able to transmit across an air gap into another piece of glass.\n\nFigure 1: Schematic of frustrated internal reflection.\nTo simplify our modeling of the above system, we'll look only in the direction across the air gap, assuming\nthat the incoming angle is such that total internal reflection occurs inside the first piece of glass, and therefore,\nthe field in the air gap is evanescent.

To find the inverse of M, use the MATLAB function inv() (e.g., x=inv(M)*C).\nProblem 8.3 - Thin Film Interference\nIn class we have seen the Fresnel equations for reflected and transmitted wave amplitudes. These equations\nassume that the materials are semi-infinite (that they continue for ever). If we look at reflections from\nsections of materials with finite thickness we have to take into account interference phenomenon in addition\nto the transmission/reflection amplitudes for semi-infinite material boundaries.

Assume it's daytime over the square meter.\n(b) One proposed spaceship propulsion system is called the 'solar sail'. These operate using momentum\ntransfer, by either reflecting or absorbing photons from an external source. Let's assume the Earth is\none big solar sail.\n1. Assuming elastic collisions (complete reflection) how much energy is transferred by one photon at\nwavelength λ = 500 nm?\n2. Repeat for inelastic collisions (complete absorption).\n3. Assuming the radius of the earth is Rearth = 6371 km, and that about 30% of the incident light\nfrom the sun is reflected and the rest is absorbed, how hard is the sun trying to push the earth\naway with light?\nProblem 9.2 - Photons and radio waves\nA radio station broadcasts at a frequency of 1.3 MHz with a total radiated power of 3 kW.\n(a) What is the wavelength of this radiation?\n(b) What is the energy (in electron-volts) of the individual quanta that compose the radiation?\nHow many photons are emitted per second? Per cycle of oscillation?\n(c) A certain radio receiver must have 4 microwatts of radiation power incident on its antenna in\norder to provide intelligible reception. How many 1.3 MHz photons does it require per second?\nPer cycle of oscillation? [Fun fact: In comparison, your eye has a sensitivity of 10 photons,\ndepending on the wavelength.a]\n(d) Do your answers in (b) and (c) indicate that the particle nature of electromagnetic radiation\n(quantization of light, ie photons) can be neglected in these circumstances?\nahttp://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Quantum/see_a_photon.html\nProblem 9.3 - Compton scattering\nIt is proposed to measure the velocity of an electron with an energy of 100 eV by taking pictures at two\ndifferent times (and at two different places), using a very sensitive digital camera and a pulsed laser. This is\ncalled a \"time of flight\" measurement.\n\n6.007 Spring 2011\nProblem Set 9: Introduction to Quantum Mechanics\ne-\nv\npi , i\ne-\nv\npf ,,f\npe\nBefore scattering\nAfter scattering\nIn the experiment, light from the laser is incident onto the electron. The laser light is focused onto a\nsquare region of 1 wavelength in length at each location where the electron is detected. The pulsed laser\ncan provide pulses of light at 600 nm, each with a duration of 1 psec, every 10 nsec. At least 100 photons\nmust scatter off the electron in order to detect the electron. Assume that all 100 photons are incident\nperpendicular to teh initial trajectory of the electron and scatter back at 180*. [You might need the following\ne\nΔf\nformulas for error propagation: For f=x+y or f=x-y, Δf =\n(Δx)2 + (Δy)2. For f=xy or f=x/y,\n=\nf\n\n( Δx )2 + ( Δy )2.]\nx\ny\n(a) Calculate the velocity of the electron. How far would you expect the electron to travel between each\npulse of light?\n(b) Attempting to measure the velocity of the electron impacts the velocity directly: Due to conservation\nof momentum the electron's momentum will be changed when a photon scatters off of it. We can\nget an estimate of the momentum transfered to the electron. How much transverse velocity will the\nelectron acquire, assuming that the photons are incident perpendicular to the initial trajectory, undergo\nCompton scattering, and scatter back?\n(c) What is the uncertainty in the photon momentum due to the focusing of laser light? Assume that\nwhen each photon scatters off the electron it transfers all of its momentum uncertainty to the electron.\nEstimate the fractional quantum uncertainty in the velocity of the electron Δv/v after 100 photons\nscatter off it.\n(d) What is the spread in photon energy ΔE associated with a 1 psec pulse?\nProblem 9.4 - Heisenberg uncertainty principle in the infinite potential well.\nThis problem shows that the Heisenberg uncertainty principle is embedded in solutions to the Schr odinger\nequation.\nConsider an electron in an infinite potential well of width L:\n\n- The quantum ground state is: ψ(x) =\nsin πx\nL\nL\n- The classical probability distribution is: P (x) = 1/L\nCalculate the following quantities:\n(a) (x)\nand (x)\nclassical\nQM\n\n(b)\nΔx\nand\nΔx2\nclassical\nQM\n(c) (p)QM where p = -il d is the quantum momentum operator.\ndx\n\n(d)\nΔp\nQM\ne\n(e) The uncertainty product\n(Δx2) (Δp2) for the quantum case in terms of l.\n(f) Repeat (e) for a well of width 10L. In which case is the overall uncertainty less?\n\n6.007 Spring 2011\nProblem Set 9: Introduction to Quantum Mechanics\nProblem 9.5 - Probability Distribution\nIn quantum mechanics, a particle is represented by a wave function. All the information of the particle like\nits position and momentum (or rather the expected value of the position and momentum) are \"encoded\" in\nthe wavefunction.The square of this wavefunction is the probability distribution of the particle i.e. it tells\nus the probability of finding the particle at a particular point in space. The probability distribution of a\nparticle (which is the square of wavefunction) is described as follows\nρ(x) = Ae-λ(x-a)2\n(1)\n(a) Calculate the normalization constant A?\n(b) Why does the probability distribution need to be normalized?\n(c) Find the expectation value, variance and standard deviation of the probability distribution.\n(d) Briefly describe the physical meaning of expectation value and standard deviation.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n6.007 Electromagnetic Energy: From Motors to Lasers\nSpring 2011\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Heat is a form of energy, and has\nunits of Joules.\n\n2. Friction is the main source of heat\nloss for all mechanical systems.\n\n3. Power is a measure of how much\nenergy is delivered per unit time.\n\nENERGY: a very old and basic notion.\n\nWhat is energy?\nEnergy is the ability to do useful work. It is the ability to\nmove something, heat something, grind something, light\nsomething ...\n\nAll other engineering disciplines study energy conversion\nthey just choose different energy inputs and outputs\n(electrical, mechanical, chemical ...)\n\nSI unit of energy ~ Joule ~ [J]\n1 J = 1 N m\n\nJoules/seconds = Watts\n\nJames Joule (1818-1889)\nPortrait in Public Domain\n\nOne joule in everyday life is approximately:\n\n- the energy required to lift a small apple one meter straight up\n\n- the energy released when that same apple falls one meter to the ground\n\n- the amount of energy, as heat,\n\nthat a quiet person generates every hundredth of a second\n\n- the energy required to heat one gram of dry, cool air by 1 degree Celsius\n\n- one thousandth of the energy a person can receive\n\nby drinking a 1mm diameter drop of juice\n(Note: 1 food Calorie = 4184 Joules. 1 food Calorie is the amount of energy\nrequired to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius)\n\n- the kinetic energy of an adult human\n\nmoving a distance of about a handspan every second.\nHow many calories do you need to eat per day?\n\nLet's make a block diagram of a system\nand consider energy flows in and out of the system:\n\nThe FIRST LAW of thermodynamics governs the behavior of\nenergy conversion systems. This \"law\" is not provable.\nIt is an accepted observation of how the universe always works.\n\nIgnoring nuclear reactions, in which energy can be converted to mass\nand vice-versa, the first law of thermodynamics says:\n\nEnergy is conserved\n\nThere are a number of equivalent ways to make this same statement. If the\nvarious energy flows W (electrical, mechanical, chemical, etc.) are all\nmeasured to be \"positive\" quantities when flowing OUT of the system (i.e.,\npositive when the system is acting as a \"source\") and Q is understood to be\n\"positive\" when flowing IN to the system (by thermodynamic convention),\nthen the first law can also be written as:\n\nThis statement of the first law says that the energy stored in the system is\nequal to the difference between the heat flowing IN to the system and the\nsum of all of the other energy flows OUT of the system.\n\nAnother way to describe the first law is by considering a \"closed cycle\" of\noperation of the system. The definition of a closed cycle of operation is a\nsequence or pattern of system behaviors that start and end at the same\nsystem state. That is, over a closed cycle of operation, the change in stored\nenergy is zero. In this case, we can express the first law this way:\n\nThat is, the sum of all of the infinitesimal flows of heat energy into a system\nover a closed cycle of operation must be offset by an equivalent sum of\ninfinitesimal work flows out of the system over the cycle in order for the net\nchange in stored energy to be zero.\n\nif and only if\n\nWhy do we make a special symbol, Q, to distinguish heat energy flow from the\nother types of energy that could flow into or out of the system?\n\nHeat is a special energy flow\n\nAll of the other types of flow are flows of energy, e.g., measured in joules.\n\nHeat flow, which also can be measured in joules, affects the universe in a\nspecial way. It increases the vibrational energy of the materials in which it\nflows. Extra vibrational energy in atoms leads to \"randomness\" or disorder in\nthe material structure. This disorder is called \"entropy\". Generation or flow\nof heat is unique in that it increases entropy. Heat flow always increases\nentropy when real (lossy, with friction, resistance, etc.) systems are involved.\n\nThe entropy of a lump of material may apparently be lowered, e.g., by\ncooling the material. This apparent reduction in entropy always occurs at the\nexpense of a greater increase in entropy somewhere else. That is, your\nrefrigerator may cool your bubbly beverage, lowering the entropy of the\ndrink. However, the entropy of your kitchen, where the heat from the\nbeverage is transferred by the refrigerator, will increase more than the\nreduction of entropy in the beverage.\n\nA Quick Word About Heat\nTemperature is a measure of random kinetic energy\nc energy\n\nEven a smooth material like mica is\nnot smooth in close-up!\nAt the microscopic level even\nthe smoothest of surfaces is\ndotted with little\n\"mountain peaks\"\n\nThe tips of the peaks are the\nonly parts that touch the\nother material\n\nOnly a very small portion of\nthe apparent surface area is in\ncontact with the other surface\n\nThis causes extremely high\npressures to form on the parts\nthat touch. This causes the two\nsurfaces to become \"welded\"\nalmost at the points of contact\nAtomic Origin of Friction\nWhy does friction depend\non the normal force ?\n\n-\nThe true surface contact area is proportional to the normal force\nbecause the peaks will deform plastically when force is applied\nincreasing the contact area\n- Plastic deformation: to change shape permanently without fracturing\n-\nOther lesser reasons for friction\n\n- Surface adhesion between pure metals\n\n- Ploughing of one surface by the other harder one\n\n- Elastic deformation\nAtomic Origin of Friction\n(a)\n(b)\n(c)\n(d)\n\nAtomic Origin of Friction\nin of Friction\n\n(Joule noted that a waterfall is\nan energy conversion system\nthat allows us to quantify energy)\n\nToday's Culture Moment\nJames Prescott Joule was an English physicist and\nbrewer, born in Salford, Lancashire. Joule studied the\nnature of heat, and discovered its relationship to\nmechanical work. This led to the theory of conservation\nof energy, which led to the development of the first law\nof thermodynamics. The SI derived unit of energy, the\njoule, is named after him. He worked with William\nThomson (later Lord Kelvin) to develop the absolute\nscale of temperature.\nJoule (1818-1889)\nFrom Wikipedia article on James Prescott Joule.\nAll images in Public Domain\n\nThe SECOND LAW of thermodynamics states that\na net increase in the entropy of the universe\nalways accompanies heat flow in practical systems\n\nAs with the first law, there are a number of different ways to state the\nsecond law.\n\nA practical consequence of the second law is that any practical machine\nthat converts energy from one form to another, e.g., a motor that\nconverts electrical energy to mechanical energy, will have an efficiency\nof conversion less than unity. That is, the efficiency or the ratio of\nmechanical power OUT divided by electrical power IN will be less than\none. Any heat flow generated by inevitable real world loss mechanisms\nlike friction and resistance will lead to unrecoverable energy losses\nduring the conversion process.\n\nBecause heat flow is also associated with changes in entropy, it receives\na special symbol, Q. Some energy conversion systems, like a refrigerator\nor a steam engine, are designed to make use of or to affect heat flows in\ntheir conversion process.\n\nOther practical systems, like electric motors or generators, inevitably generate\nsome heat, but only as an unfortunate, inevitable consequence of losses in the\nconversion process. For this second class of systems, we will often choose to\nmentally \"move\" the heat generating loss mechanisms out of the \"box\" that\ndescribes the system, so that we can focus on the pure conversion from one non-\nheat energy flow (e.g., electrical energy from a battery) to another non-heat\nenergy flow (e.g., mechanical speed of a motor shaft).\n\nFor example, we might model a motor this way:\n\nIf we consider the total system, we have to account for the heat transfers in applying the\nfirst law. That is, we need an equation with W's and Q's.\n\nIf we focus on the \"lossless motor\", then we can look at equations that just involve W's.\nOf course, we have to be careful to focus on the \"right\" W's, the energy flows that occur\nafter we \"pay\" for the resistive losses and \"before\" we pay for the friction losses. Done\ncarefully, this focus on the lossless motor will let us study the \"pure\" conversion process\nfrom one domain (electrical) to another (mechanical). In a practical system, we must\nremember that, after studying the lossless system, the losses must also be accounted.\n\nA typical farm horse, for example, can pull harder and make a\nheavy stone block move at a higher velocity than a typical person.\nThe horse is more powerful than the person.\n\nJames Watt studied energy conversion by observing the work of a\nhorse (mine pony) in lifting coal out of a coal mine. He found that,\non the average, a mine pony could pull (lift by means of a pulley)\n22,000 foot-pounds per minute. Rather than call this \"pony\" power,\nhe increased these test results by 50 percent, and called it\nhorsepower (hp) i.e. 33,000 foot-pounds of work per minute.\n\nJames Watt\n(1736-1819)\nAside:\nR. D. Stevenson and R. J. Wasserzug published an article in\nNature 364, 195-195 (15 July 1993) calculating the upper limit\nto an animal's power output. The peak power over a few\nseconds has been measured to be as high as 14.9 hp. However,\nfor longer periods an average horse produces less than one\nhorsepower. - Wikipedia\nhorse stable inside a mine\nPOWER is the rate at which energy is delivered\nThe same job accomplished more quickly\nimplies a higher power applied to the job\n1 hp = 746 Watts (units used in Watt's honor)\nAll images in Public Domain\nFrom Wikipedia article on horsepower.\n\nThe ports of many energy conversion systems are conveniently described by a set of\n\"through\" and \"across\" measurements or variables. The different types of \"through\"\nand \"across variables\" distinguish different types of engineers\n(electrical, mechanical, chemical, etc.). The first and second laws apply to everyone.\n\n\"ACROSS\" variables typically measure how hard we are \"pushing\".\nTypical \"across\" variables include:\n\nForce, from mechanical engineering, measured in Newtons (N = kg*m/(s*s))\nVoltage, from electrical engineering, measured in volts (V)\nTorque, or twisting force, from mechanical engineering, measured in N-m\nPressure, from ocean/aero engineering, measured in N/(m*m)\n\nAssociated \"THROUGH\" variables typically measure how much \"stuff\" is flowing:\n\nVelocity, from mechanical engineering, measured in meters/sec (m/s)\nCurrent, from electrical engineering, measured in Coulombs/sec or Amps\nAngular Velocity, from mechanical engineering, measured in rads/sec\nFlow, from ocean/aero engineering, measured in volume/sec or m*m*m/s\n\nAcross and Through Variables\n\nPower is a very old and basic concept\n\nfor any moving, living being on the earth.\n\nPower is the product of an \"across\" variable and a \"through\" variable.\n\nIn more colloquial terms, it is a composite metric or product of\n\"how hard we're pushing\" (the across variable) and\n\"how much is flowing in response to the pushing\" (the through variable).\n\nFOR EXAMPLE:\n\n- Mechanical power is force times velocity.\n\n- Electrical power is voltage times current.\n\nPower, whether electrical, mechanical, or in some other discipline,\nis measured in units of Watts in the SI/MKS system.\n\nHow many Joules are in one kW hour ?\n\nU.S. Energy Use\n\nCoal\nWe have lots of it.\nTwice as much CO2 per kW-h as Gas,\n50% more than oil; can only rely on it if sequestration is practical and\nstable.\n\nGas\nCandidate \"transition\" fuel,\nbut will have same supply issues as oil (just delayed).\n\nNuclear\nChallenges in disposal, proliferation\n\nBIOMASS\nGEOTHERMAL\nWIND\nSOLAR &\nOTHER\nS\nWIND IS THE FASTES GROWIN\n21G RENEWABLE TECHNOLOGY\nNon-Hydro Renewable Electricity Generation in the USA (TWh)\n\nSolar Water Heating System\nstore &\nheat exchangers\nr Water Heating System\nchangers\n\nBrasil\n5%\nIrsael\n6%\nJapan\n10%\n0%\nTurkey\n17%\nEuropean\nUnion\n42%\nUnited\nStates\n4%\nIndia\n4%\nAustralia\n3%\nSouth\nKorea\n2%\nOther\n7%\nSolar Hot Water/Heating\nExisting Capacity, 2008\nSource REN21 - \"Renewables\n2010 Global Status Report\"\n\nTotal = 149 GWthh\n\n230.54\n207.57\n206.93\n102.65\n90.38\n68.18\n56.19\n49.47\n48.19\n41.55\n39.35\n38.9\n37.06\n32.68\n23.94\n18.19\n17.47\n16.18\n15.41\n13.61\n12.33\n11.97\n11.69\n9.43\n9.12\n8.81\n5.89\n5.48\n3.45\n2.95\n2.94\n2.68\n2.49\n2.31\n2.27\n2.23\n1.89\n1.61\n1.17\n1.09\nCyprus\nIsrael\nAustria\nBarbados\nGreece\nJordan\nTurkey\nGermany\nAustralia\nChina\nDenmark\nMalta\nSwitzerland\nSlovenia\nJapan\nTaiwan\nLuxembourg\nSweden\nNew Zealand\nPortugal\nSpain\nNetherlands\nTunisia\nFrance\nBrazil\nSlovak Republic\nAlbania\nItaly\nBelgium\nCzech Republic\nMacedonia\nUnited States\nSouth Africa\nPoland\nUnited Kingdom\nIreland\nMexico\nBulgaria\nRomania\nFinland\nCanada\nNorway\nLatvia\nNamibia\nSource: Weiss et al., \"Solar Heat Worldwide\"\nUSA\nUSA has not widely\nadopted Solar Water\nHeating\n\nTotal capacity per 1,000 inhabitants [kWth]\nTotal capacity of\nglazed flat-plate\nand evacuated\ntube collectors in\noperation at the\nend of 2006\n\nSource REN21 - \"Renewables 2010 Global Status Report\"\nOther\n4%\nOther EU\n7%\nSouth Korea\n2% Italy\n5%\nUnited States\n6%\nJapan\n13%\nSpain\n16%\nGermany\n47%\nSolar PV Existing Capacity,\nTop Six Countries, 2009\nGlobal Total = 21 GW\n\nBATTERY\nELECTRICAL MOTOR\nFORWARD\nNEUTRAL\nREVERSE\nHere's an energy conversion system:\nAN ELECTRIC GO-CART\n(converts the electrical energy of the battery into mechanical motion)\n(and the origins of the e\ntomorrow we will make measure\nnergy crisis facing the world)\ntions on our go-cart.\nments and calcula\nGo-cart designed and built by Prof. Steven B.

The field causes the magnetic moments in each of the domains to begin to\nalign. When the magnetizing force H is eliminated, the domains relax, but don't return to their\noriginal random orientation, leaving a remanent flux Br ; that is, the material becomes a \"permanent\nmagnet.\" One way to demagnetize the material is to heat it to a high enough temperature (called\nthe Curie temperature) that the domains once again take on their random orientation. For iron, the\nCurie temperature is 770oC.\nBEHAVIOR OF AN INITIALLY UNMAGNETIZED MATERIAL\nDomain configuration during\nseveral stages of magnetization\nhysteresis\nH\nB,J\nH\nSlope =\nInitial\nMagnetization\nCurve\nBs\nBr\n-HC\nHC\n-Br\n-Bs\nμ\nH > 0\n\nMagnetic Materials\nWhich has lower energy ?\nOrbital 1\nOrbital 2\nOrbital 1\nOrbital 2\nAtomic Number\nElement\nElectronic Structure of 3d\n(μ\n\nMoment\nB)\nSc\n\nTi\n\nV\n\nCr\n\nMn\n\nFe\n\nCo\n\nNi\n\nCu\n= electron spin orientation\n\nMagnetic Materials\nmagnetic susceptibility χm\n:\n;\n3:\n\n.-4,7/\n.-3,3/\n\n-45\n-3;\n-44\n.-8,5/\n9,;\n.-6,2/\n\n! ! %\n:,3\n7,9\n-5,6\n-45\n-34\n.-44/ .-33/\n\n%# $ * # & %\n%\n7,9\n3:3\n5:5\n:4:\n4,38\n3,98\n2,83\n-;,9\n-34\n-45\n-9,5\n-7,6\n-3:\n-38\n.-38/\n% % $ * ##\n6,6\n32;\n33;\n9:5\n-47\n-3;\n-:,4\n4,6\n-89\n-46\n-44\n.-46/\n& & % ' * ! $\n'\n#\n7,5\n8,9\n9:\n;8\n-56\n-4:\n-58\n-38\n-375\nAll values given for a temperature of 300 K\n\n\"#(\nIn case of ferromagnetic materials: saturation\n\npolarization\n%\"#(\n\n%%$\"#(\nnumbers without ():\nnumbers with():\n·10-6\n·10-9\n\nMagnetic refrigeration\nN\nHeat Irradiation\nMagnetic Field\nS\nImage in the Public Domain\nOne of the most notable examples of the magnetocaloric effect is in the\nchemical element gadolinium and some of its alloys.

Here is an example in which current does not gives\nrise to the magnetic field:\nConsider the case of charging up a capacitor C which is connected to very long wires.\nThe charging current is I. From the symmetry it is easy to see that an application of\nAmpere's law will produce B fields which go in circles around the wire and whose\nmagnitude is B(r) = μoI/(2πr). But there is no charge flow in the gap across the capacitor\nplates and according to Ampere's law the B field in the plane parallel to the capacitor\nplates and going through the capacitor gap should be zero!\nThis seems unphysical.\nSide\nView\nB\nB\nB\nB = 0??\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nAmpere's Law Revisited (cont.)\nIf instead we drew the Amperian surface as sketched below,\nwe would have concluded that B in non-zero !\n\nB\nB\nSide\nView\nI\nI\nI\nI\nB\nMaxwell resolved this problem by adding a term to the Ampere's Law.\nIn equivalence to Faraday's Law,\nthe changing electric field can generate the magnetic field:\n\nd\n\nl\nC\n·\nCOMPLETE\nH\nd =\n\nAMPERE'S LAW\nS\n·\n\nJ\ndA + dt\n\nS\nε E · d A\n\nFaraday's Law and Motional emf\nWhat is the emf over the resistor ?\ndΦ\nemf = -\nmag\nIn a short time Δt the bar moves a\ndistance Δx = v*Δt, and the flux\nincreases by ΔФmag = B (L v*Δt)\nThere is an increase in flux through the circuit\nas the bar of length L moves to the right\n(orthogonal to magnetic field H) at velocity, v.\nfrom Chabay and Sherwood, Ch 22\ndt\nemf = ΔΦmag\nΔt\n= BLv\nL\nvΔt\nv\nB\n\nFaraday's Law for a Coil\nfrom Chabay and Sherwood, Ch 22\nWill the current run\nCLOCKWISE or ANTICLOCKWISE ?\nRotating a bar of magnet (or the coil)\nproduces a time-varying magnetic field\ninside the coil\nMoving a magnet towards a coil produces a\ntime-varying magnetic field inside the coil\nThe induced emf in a coil of N turns is equal to\nN times the rate of change of the magnetic flux on one loop of the coil.\n\nComplex Magnetic Systems\nDC Brushless\nStepper Motor\nReluctance Motor\nInduction Motor\nWe need better (more powerful) tools...\nMagnetic Circuits: Reduce Maxwell to (scalar) circuit problem\nEnergy Method: Look at change in stored energy to calculate force\n\nH\nC\n·\ndl = Ienclosed\n\nB\nS\n·\n\ndA = 0\nf = q\n\nv × B\n\nMagnetic Flux\nΦ [Wb] (Webers)\nMagnetic Flux Density\nB [Wb/m2] = T (Tesla\nMagnetic Field Intensity\nH [Amp-turn/m]\ndue to macroscopic\n& microscopic\ns)\ndue to macroscopic\ncurrents\nFaraday's Law\n\nH\n\nB = μo\n+ M\n\n= μo\n\nH + χmH\n= μoμrH\ndΦ\nemf = -\nmag\ndt\nemf =\n\nENC ·\ndl\nand Φmag =\n\n·\n\nB\nˆndA\n\nExample: Magnetic Write Head\nBit density is limited by how well the field can be localized in write head\nHorizontal\nMagnetized Bits\nRing Inductive\nWrite Head\nShield\nGMR\nRead\nHead\nRecording Medium\n\nReview: Ferromagnetic Materials\nhysteresis\nB\nB,J\nH\nC\nr\nH : coercive magnetic field strength\nS\nB : remanence flux density\nB : saturation flux density\nH\nInitial\nMagnetization\nCurve\nSlope =\ni\nBehavior of an initially unmagnetized\nmaterial.\nDomain configuration during several stages\nof magnetization.\nBs\nBr\n-HC\nHC\n-Br\n-Bs\nμ\nH > 0\n\nThin Film Write Head\nHow do we apply Ampere's Law to this geometry (low symmetry) ?\nRecording Current\nMagnetic Head Coil\nMagnetic Head Core\nRecording Magnetic\nField\n\nH\nC\n·\ndl =\n\nJ\nS\n·\n\ndA\n\nElectrical Circuit Analogy\nCharge is conserved...\nFlux is 'conserved'...\nElectrical\nФ\nEQUIVALENT\nCIRCUITS\nMagnetic\ni\ni\ni\n+\nV\n\nS\nB · d A = 0\nV\ni\nφ\nR\nI\nR\n\nElectrical Circuit Analogy\nElectromotive force (charge push)=\nMagneto-motive force (flux push)=\nElectrical\nФ\nMagnetic\nEQUIVALENT\nCIRCUITS\nV\ni\ni\nφ\nR\nI\n\nC\nH · dl = Ienclosed\nv =\n\nE · dl\n+\nV\ni\ni\nR\n\nElectrical Circuit Analogy\nMaterial properties and geometry determine flow -

      "content": "3.3 CONDITIONS FOR FIELDS TO BE QUASISTATIC\nAn appreciation for the quasistatic approximations will come with a consideration\nof many case studies. Justification of one or the other of the approximations hinges\non using the quasistatic fields to estimate the \"error\" fields, which are then hopefully\nfound to be small compared to the original quasistatic fields.\nIn developing any mathematical \"theory\" for the description of some part of\nthe physical world, approximations are made. Conclusions based on this \"theory\"\nshould indeed be made with a concern for implicit approximations made out of\nignorance or through oversight. But in making quasistatic approximations, we are\nfortunate in having available the \"exact\" laws. These can always be used to test\nthe validity of a tentative approximation.\nProvided that the system of interest has dimensions that are all within a factor\nof two or so of each other, order of magnitude arguments easily illustrate how the\nerror fields are related to the quasistatic fields. The examples shown in Fig. 3.3.1\nare not to be considered in detail, but rather should be regarded as prototypes. The\ncandidate for the EQS approximation in part (a) consists of metal spheres that are\ninsulated from each other and driven by a source of EMF. In the case of part (b),\nwhich is proposed for the MQS approximation, a current source drives a current\naround a oneturn loop. The dimensions are \"on the same order\" if the diameter of\none of the spheres, is within a factor of two or so of the spacing between spheres\nExcerpt from H.A. Haus and J. R. Melcher. Electromagnetic Fields and Energy.\nEnglewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1989.\n\nSec. 3.3\nConditions for Quasistatics\nFig. 3.3.1\nPrototype systems involving one typical length. (a) EQS system\nin which source of EMF drives a pair of perfectly conducting spheres having\nradius and spacing on the order of L. (b) MQS system consisting of perfectly\nconducting loop driven by current source. The radius of the loop and diameter\nof its crosssection are on the order of L.\nand if the diameter of the conductor forming the loop is within a similar factor of\nthe diameter of the loop.\nIf the system is pictured as made up of \"perfect conductors\" and \"perfect\ninsulators,\" the decision as to whether a quasistatic field ought to be classified as\nEQS or MQS can be made by a simple rule of thumb: Lower the time rate of change\n(frequency) of the driving source so that the fields become static. If the magnetic\nfield vanishes in this limit, then the field is EQS; if the electric field vanishes the\nfield is MQS. In reality, materials are not \"perfect,\" neither perfect conductors nor\nperfect insulators. Therefore, the usefulness of this rule depends on understanding\nunder what circumstances materials tend to behave as \"perfect\" conductors, and\ninsulators. Fortunately, nature provides us with metals that are extremely good\nconductors- and with gases, liquids, and solids that are very good insulators- so\nthat this rule is a good intuitive starting point. Chapters 7, 10, and 15 will provide\na more mature view of how to classify quasistatic systems.\nThe quasistatic laws are now used in the order summarized by (3.2.5)(3.2.9)\nto estimate the field magnitudes. With only one typical length scale L, we can\napproximate spatial derivatives that make up the curl and divergence operators\nby 1/L.\nELECTROQUASISTATIC\nMAGNETOQUASISTATIC\nThus, it follows from Gauss' law, (3.2.5a),\nthat typical values of E and ρ are re\nlated by\noE\nρL\n= ρ ⇒E =\n(1a)\nL\no\nThus, it follows from Amp`ere's law,\n(3.2.5b), that typical values of H\nand J are related by\nH = J ⇒ H = JL\n(1b)\nL\nAs suggested by the integral forms of the laws so far used, these fields and\ntheir sources are sketched in Fig. 3.3.1. The EQS laws will predict E lines that\noriginate on the positive charges on one electrode and terminate on the negative\ncharges on the other. The MQS laws will predict lines of H that close around the\ncirculating current.\nIf the excitation were sinusoidal in time, the characteristic time τ for the\n\nIntroduction To Electroquasistatics and Magnetoquasistatics\nChapter 3\nsinusoidal steady state response would be the reciprocal of the angular frequency\nω. In any case, if the excitations are time varying, with a characteristic time τ, then\nthe time varying charge implies a cur\nrent, and this in turn induces an H.\nWe could compute the current in the\nconductors from charge conservation,\n(3.2.7a), but because we are interested\nin the induced H, we use Amp`ere's\nlaw, (3.2.8a), evaluated in the free space\nregion. The electric field is replaced in\nfavor of the charge density in this ex\npression using (1a).\nH\noE\n=\n⇒\nL\nτ\n(2a)\nL2\nH =\n=\noEL\nρ\nτ\nτ\nthe timevarying current implies an\nH that is timevarying. In accor\ndance with Faraday's law, (3.2.7b),\nthe result is an induced E.

That is,\nthe term originally neglected in (3.2.1a)\nis now estimated, and from this a curl\nof an error field evaluated.\nEerror = μoρL2\n⇒\nL\nτ 2\n(3a)\nμoρL3\nEerror =\nτ 2\nThe magnetic field induced by the\ndisplacement current represents an\nerror field.

Note that whether (4a) is used to represent the EQS\nsystem or (4b) is used for the MQS system, the conditions on the spatial scale L\nand time τ (perhaps the reciprocal frequency) are the same.\nBoth the EQS and MQS approximations are predicated on having sufficiently\nslow time variations (low frequencies) and sufficiently small dimensions so that\nμo2oL2\nL\n¿ 1 ⇒\n¿ τ\n(5)\nτ 2\nc\nwhere c = 1/ √ 2oμo. The ratio L/c is the time required for an electromagnetic wave\nto propagate at the velocity c over a length L characterizing the system. Thus,\neither of the quasistatic approximations is valid if an electromagnetic wave can\npropagate a characteristic length of the system in a time that is short compared to\ntimes τ of interest.\nIf the conditions that must be fulfilled in order to justify the quasistatic ap\nproximations are the same, how do we know which approximation to use? For\nsystems modeled by free space and perfect conductors, such as we have considered\nhere, the answer comes from considering the fields that are retained in the static\nlimit (infinite τ or zero frequency ω).\nRecapitulating the rule expressed earlier, consider the pair of spheres shown\nin Fig. 3.3.1a. Excited by a constant source of EMF, they are charged, and the\ncharges give rise to an electric field. But in this static limit, there is no current and\nhence no magnetic field. Thus, the static system is dominated by the electric field,\nand it is natural to represent it as being EQS even if the excitation is timevarying.\nExcited by a dc source, the circulating current in Fig. 3.3.1b gives rise to a\nmagnetic field, but there are no charges with attendant electric fields. This time it\nis natural to use the MQS approximation when the excitation is time varying.\nExample 3.3.1.\nEstimate of Error Introduced by Electroquasistatic\nApproximation\nConsider a simple structure fed by a set of idealized sources of EMF as shown\nin Fig. 3.3.2. Two circular metal disks, of radius b, are spaced a distance d apart.\nA distribution of EMF generators is connected between the rims of the plates so\nthat the complete system, plates and sources, is cylindrically symmetric. With the\nunderstanding that in subsequent chapters we will be examining the underlying\nphysical processes, for now we assume that, because the plates are highly conducting,\nE must be perpendicular to their surfaces.\nThe electroquasistatic field laws are represented by (3.2.5a) and (3.2.6a). A\nsimple solution for the electric field between the plates is\nE\nE =\niz ≡ Eoiz\n(6)\nd\n\nIntroduction To Electroquasistatics and Magnetoquasistatics\nChapter 3\nFig. 3.3.2\nPlane parallel electrodes having no resistance, driven at\ntheir outer edges by a distribution of sources of EMF.\nFig. 3.3.3\nParallel plates of Fig. 3.3.2, showing volume containing\nlower plate and radial surface current density at its periphery.\nwhere the sign definition of the EMF, E, is as indicated in Fig. 3.3.2. The field\nof (6) satisfies (3.2.5a) and (3.2.6a) in the region between the plates because it\nis both irrotational and solenoidal (no charge is assumed to exist in the region\nbetween the plates). Further, the field has no component tangential to the plates\nwhich is consistent with the assumption of plates with no resistance. Finally, Gauss'\njump condition, (1.3.17), can be used to find the surface charges on the top and\nbottom plates. Because the fields above the upper plate and below the lower plate\nare assumed to be zero, the surface charge densities on the bottom of the top plate\nand on the top of the bottom plate are\n- oEz(z = d) = - oEo;\nz = d\nσs =\n(7)\noEz(z = 0) =\noEo;\nz = 0\nThere remains the question of how the electric field in the neighborhood of the\ndistributed source of EMF is constrained. We assume here that these sources are\nconnected in such a way that they make the field uniform right out to the outer\nedges of the plates. Thus, it is consistent to have a field that is uniform throughout\nthe entire region between the plates. Note that the surface charge density on the\nplates is also uniform out to r = b. At this point, (3.2.5a) and (3.2.6a) are satisfied\nbetween and on the plates.\nIn the EQS order of laws, conservation of charge comes next. Rather than using\nthe differential form, (3.2.7a), we use the integral form, (1.5.2). The volume V is a\ncylinder of circular crosssection enclosing the lower plate, as shown in Fig. 3.3.3. Be\ncause the radial surface current density in the plate is independent of φ, integration\nof J · da on the enclosing surface amounts to multiplying Kr by the circumference,\nwhile the integration over the volume is carried out by multiplying σs by the surface\narea, because the surface charge density is uniform. Thus,\ndEo\nb o dEo\nKr2πb + πb2\no\n= 0 ⇒ Kr\n�\nr=b = -\n(8)\ndt\ndt\nIn order to find the magnetic field, we make use of the \"secondary\" EQS\nlaws, (3.2.8a) and (3.2.9a). Amp`ere's law in integral form, (1.4.1), is convenient for\nthe present case of high symmetry. The displacement current is z directed, so the\n\nSec. 3.3\nConditions for Quasistatics\nFig. 3.3.4\nCrosssection of system shown in Fig. 3.3.2 showing surface\nand contour used in evaluating correction E field.\nsurface S is taken as being in the free space region between the plates and having a\nzdirected normal.\ni\nl\n∂ oE\nH · ds =\n· izda\n(9)\n∂t\nC\nS\nThe symmetry of structure and source suggests that H must be φ independent.

The correct statement\nof Faraday's law is (3.2.1a), with the magnetic induction retained. Now that the\nquasistatic H has been determined, we are in a position to compute the curl of E\nthat it generates.\nAgain, for this highly symmetric configuration, it is best to use the integral\nlaw. Because H is φ directed, the surface is chosen to have its normal in the φ\ndirection, as shown in Fig. 3.3.4. Thus, Faraday's integral law (1.6.1) becomes\ni\nl\n∂μoHφ\nE · ds = -\niφ · da\n(11)\n∂t\nC\nS\nWe use the contour shown in Fig. 3.3.4 and assume that the E induced by the\nmagnetic induction is independent of z. Because the tangential E field is zero on\nthe plates, the only contributions to the line integral on the left in (11) come from\nthe vertical legs of the contour. The surface integral on the right is evaluated using\n(10).\nb\nμo od l\nl\nl d2Eo\n[Ez(b) - Ez(r)]d =\nr dr\ndt2\nr\n(12)\nd2\nμo od\nEo\n=\n(b - r )\ndt2\nThe field at the outer edge is constrained by the EMF sources to be Eo, and so it\nfollows from (12) that to this order of approximation the electric field is\noμo d2Eo\nEz = Eo +\n(r 2 - b2)\n(13)\ndt2\nWe have found that the electric field at r = b differs from the field at the edge. How\nbig is the difference? This depends on the time rate of variation of the electric field.\n\nIntroduction To Electroquasistatics and Magnetoquasistatics\nChapter 3\nFor purposes of illustration, assume that the electric field is sinusoidally varying\nwith time.\nEo(t) = A cos ωt\n(14)\nThus, the time characterizing the dynamics is 1/ω.\nIntroducing this expression into (13), and calling the second term the \"error\nfield,\" the ratio of the error field and the field at the rim, where r = b, is\n|Eerror |\n=\nω2\noμo(b - r 2)\n(15)\nEo\nThe error field will be negligible compared to the quasistatic field if\nω2\noμob2\n¿ 1\n(16)\nfor all r between the plates.

Hence, if\nwe build a circular disk capacitor and excite it at a frequency of 1 MHz, then the\nquasistatic laws will give a good approximation to the actual field as long as the\nradius of the disk is much less than 300 meters.\nThe correction field for a MQS system is found by following steps that are\nanalogous to those used in the previous example. Once the magnetic and electric\nfields have been determined using the MQS laws, the error magnetic field induced\nby the displacement current can be found.\n3.4 QUASISTATIC SYSTEMS1\nWhether we ignore the magnetic induction and use the EQS approximation, or\nneglect the displacement current and make a MQS approximation, times of interest\nτ must be long compared to the time τem required for an electromagnetic wave to\npropagate at the velocity c over the largest length L of the system.\nτem = L ¿ τ\n(1)\nc\n1 This section makes use of the integral laws at a level somewhat more advanced than neces\nsary in preparation for the next chapter. It can be skipped without loss of continuity.\n\nSec. 3.4\nQuasistatic Systems\nFig. 3.4.1\nRange of characteristic times over which quasistatic approxima\ntion is valid. The transit time of an electromagnetic wave is τem while τ? is a\ntime characterizing the dynamics of the quasistatic system.\nFig. 3.4.2\n(a) Quasistatic system showing (b) its EQS subsystem and\n(c) its MQS subsystem.\nThis requirement is given a graphic representation in Fig. 3.4.1.\nFor a given characteristic time (for example, a given reciprocal frequency), it\nis clear from (1) that the region described by the quasistatic laws is limited in size.\nSystems can often be divided into subregions that are small enough to be quasistatic\nbut, by virtue of being interconnected through their boundaries, are dynamic in\ntheir behavior. With the elements regarded as the subregions, electric circuits are\nan example. In the physical world of perfect conductors and free space (to which we\nare presently limited), it is the topology of the conductors that determines whether\nthese subregions are EQS or MQS.\nA system that is described by quasistatic laws but retains a dynamical be\nhavior exhibits one or more characteristic times. On the characteristic time axis in\nFig. 3.4.1, τ? is one such time. The quasistatic system model provides a meaningful\ndescription provided that the one or more characteristic times τ? are long compared\nto τem. The following example illustrates this concept.\nExample 3.4.1.\nA Quasistatic System Exhibiting Resonance\nShown in crosssection in Fig. 3.4.2 is a resonator used in connection with electron\nbeam devices at microwave frequencies. The volume enclosed by its perfectly con\nducting boundaries can be broken into the two regions shown. The first of these is\nbounded by a pair of circular plane parallel conductors having spacing d and radius\nb. This region is EQS and described in Example 3.3.1.\nThe second region is bounded by coaxial, perfectly conducting cylinders which\nform an annular region having outside radius a and an inside radius b that matches\nup to the outer edge of the lower plate of the EQS system. The coaxial cylinders are\n\nIntroduction To Electroquasistatics and Magnetoquasistatics\nChapter 3\nFig. 3.4.3\nSurface S and contour C for evaluating Hfield using Amp`ere's\nlaw.\nshorted by a perfectly conducting plate at the bottom, where z = 0. A similar plate\nat the top, where z = h, connects the outer cylinder to the outer edge of the upper\nplate in the EQS subregion.\nFor the moment, the subsystems are isolated from each other by driving the\nMQS system with a current source Ko (amps/meter) distributed around the periph\nery of the gap between conductors. This gives rise to axial surface current densities\nof Ko and -Ko(b/a) on the inner and outer cylindrical conductors and radial surface\ncurrent densities contributing to J · da in the upper and lower plates, respectively.\n(Note that these satisfy the MQS current continuity requirement.)\nBecause of the symmetry, the magnetic field can be determined by using the\nintegral MQS form of Amp`ere's law. So that there is a contribution to the integration\nof J · da, a surface is selected with a normal in the axial direction. This surface is\nenclosed by a circular contour having the radius r, as shown in Fig. 3.4.3. Because\nof the axial symmetry, Hφ is independent of φ, and the integrations on S and C\namount to multiplications.\ni\nl\nH · ds =\n·\n⇒ 2πrHφ = 2πbKo\n(2)\nJ izda\nC\nS\nThus, in the annulus,\nb\nHφ =\nKo\n(3)\nr\nIn the regions outside the annulus, H is zero. Note that this is consistent with\nAmp`ere's jump condition, (1.4.16), evaluated on any of the boundaries using the\nalready determined surface current densities. Also, we will find in Chap. 10 that\nthere can be no timevarying magnetic flux density normal to a perfectly conducting\nboundary. The magnetic field given in (3) satisfies this condition as well.\nIn the hierarchy of MQS laws, we have now satisfied (3.2.5b) and (3.2.6b) and\ncome next to Faraday's law, (3.2.7b). For the present purposes, we are not interested\nin the details of the distribution of electric field. Rather, we use the integral form of\nFaraday's law, (1.6.1), integrated on the surface S shown in Fig. 3.4.4. The integral\nof E · ds along the perfect conductor vanishes and we are left with\nb\nl\ndλf\nEab =\nE · ds =\n(4)\ndt\na\nwhere the EMF across the gap is as defined by (1.6.2), and the flux linked by C is\nconsistent with (1.6.8).\nl\nl\ndr\nλf = h\na\nμoHφdr = μobhKo\na\n= μohb ln a\nKo\n(5)\nr\nb\nb\nb\n\nSec. 3.4\nQuasistatic Systems\nFig. 3.4.4\nSurface S and contour C used to determine EMF using\nFaraday's law.\nThese last two expressions combine to give\na dKo\nEab = μohb ln\n(6)\nb\ndt\nJust as this expression serves to relate the EMF and surface current density at the\ngap of the MQS system, (3.3.8) relates the gap variables defined in Fig. 3.4.2b for the\nEQS subsystem. The subsystems are now interconnected by replacing the distributed\ncurrent source driving the MQS system with the peripheral surface current density\nof the EQS system.\nKr + Ko = 0\n(7)\nIn addition, the EMF's of the two subsystems are made to match where they join.\n-E = Eab\n(8)\nWith (3.3.8) and (3.3.6), respectively, substituted for Kr and Eab, these expressions\nbecome two differential equations in the two variables Eo and Ko describing the\ncomplete system.\nb o dEo\n-\n+ Ko = 0\n(9)\ndt\na dKo\n-dEo = μobh ln\n(10)\nb\ndt\nElimination of Ko between these expressions gives\nd2Eo + ωo\n2Eo = 0\n(11)\ndt2\nwhere ωo is defined as\n2d\nω2 =\n(12)\no\noμohb2 ln\na\nb\nand it follows that solutions are a linear combination of sin ωot and cos ωot.\nAs might have been suspected from the outset, what we have found is a re\nsponse to initial conditions that is oscillatory, with a natural frequency ωo. That is,\nthe parallel plate capacitor that comprises the EQS subsystem, connected in parallel\nwith the oneturn inductor that is the MQS subsystem, responds to initial values\nof Eo and Ko with an oscillation that at one instant has Eo at its peak magnitude\nand Ko = 0, and a quarter cycle later has Eo = 0 and Ko at its peak magnitude.\n\nIntroduction To Electroquasistatics and Magnetoquasistatics\nChapter 3\nFig. 3.4.5\nIn terms of characteristic time τ, the dynamic regime in which the\nsystem of Fig. 3.4.2 is quasistatic but capable of being in a state of resonance.\nRemember that\noEo is the surface charge density on the lower plate in the EQS\nsection. Thus, the oscillation is between the charges in the EQS subsystem and the\ncurrents in the MQS subsystem. The distribution of field sources in the system as a\nwhole is determined by a dynamical interaction between the two subsystems.\nIf the system were driven by a current source having the frequency ω, it\nwould display a resonance at the natural frequency ωo. Under what conditions can\nthe system be in resonance and still be quasistatic? In this case, the characteristic\ntime for the system dynamics is the reciprocal of the resonance frequency. The EQS\nsubsystem is indeed EQS if b/c ¿ τ, while the annular subsystem is MQS if h/c ¿ τ.\nThus, the resonance is correctly described by the quasistatic model if the times have\nthe ordering shown in Fig. 3.4.5. Essentially, this is achieved by making the spacing\nd in the EQS section very small.\nWith the region of interest containing media, the appropriate quasistatic limit\nis often as much determined by the material properties as by the topology. In\nChaps. 7 and 10, we will consider lossy materials where the distributions of field\nsources depend on the time rates of change and a given region can be EQS or MQS\ndepending on the electrical conductivity. We return to the subject of quasistatics\nin Chaps. 12 and 14.\n3.5 OVERVIEW OF APPLICATIONS\nElectroquasistatics is the subject of Chaps. 4-7 and magnetoquasistatics the topic\nof Chaps. 8-10. Before embarking on these subjects, consider in this section some\npractical examples that fall in each category, and some that involve the electrody\nnamics of Chaps. 12-14.\nOur starting point is at location A at the upper right in Fig. 3.5.1. With\nfrequencies that range from 60400 MHz, television signals propagate from remote\nlocations to our homes as electromagnetic waves. If the frequency is f, the field\npasses through one period in the time 1/f. Setting this equal to the transit time,\n(3.1.l7) gives an expression for the wavelength, the distance the wave travels during\none cycle.\nc\nL ≡ λ = f\nThus, for channel 2 (60 MHz) the wavelength is about 5 m, while for channel 54 it\nis about 20 cm. The distance between antenna and receiver is many wavelengths,\nand hence the fields undergo many oscillations while traversing the space between\nthe two. The dynamics is not quasistatic but rather intimately involves the electro\nmagnetic wave represented by inset B and described in Sec. 3.1.\n\nSec. 3.5\nOverview of Applications\nFig. 3.5.1\nQuasistatic and electrodynamic fields in the physical world.\nThe field induces charges and currents in the antenna, and the resulting sig\nnals are conveyed to the TV set by a transmission line. At TV frequencies, the line\nis likely to be many wavelengths long. Hence, the fields surrounding the line are also\nnot quasistatic. But the radial distributions of current in the elements of the anten\nnas and in the wires of the transmission line are governed by magnetoquasistatic\n(MQS) laws. As suggested by inset C, the current density tends to concentrate\n\nIntroduction To Electroquasistatics and Magnetoquasistatics\nChapter 3\nadjacent to the conductor surfaces and this skin effect is MQS.\nInside the television set, in the transistors and picture tube that convert the\nsignal to an image and sound, electroquasistatic (EQS) processes abound. Included\nare dynamic effects in the transistors (E) that result from the time required for an\nelectron or hole to migrate a finite distance through a semiconductor. Also included\nare the effects of inertia as the electrons are accelerated by the electric field in the\npicture tube (D). On the other hand, the speaker that transduces the electrical\nsignals into sound is most likely MQS.\nElectromagnetic fields are far closer to the viewer than the television set. As\nis obvious to those who have had an electrocardiogram, the heart (F) is the source\nof a pulsating current. Are the distributions of these currents and the associated\nfields described by the EQS or MQS approximation? On the largest scales of the\nbody, we will find that it is MQS.\nOf course, there are many other sources of electrical currents in the body.\nNerve conduction and other electrical activity in the brain occur on much smaller\nlength scales and can involve regions of much less conductivity. These cases can be\nEQS.\nElectrical power systems provide diverse examples as well. The stepdown\ntransformer on a pole outside the home (G) is MQS, with dynamical processes\nincluding eddy currents and hysteresis.\nThe energy in all these examples originates in the fuel burned in a power\nplant. Typically, a steam turbine drives a synchronous alternator (H). The fields\nwithin this generator of electrical power are MQS. However, most of the electronics\nin the control room (J) are described by the EQS approximation. In fact, much\nof the payoff in making computer components smaller is gained by having them\nremain EQS even as the bit rate is increased. The electrostatic precipitator (I),\nused to remove flyash from the combustion gases before they are vented from the\nstacks, seems to be an obvious candidate for the EQS approximation. Indeed, even\nthough some modern precipitators use pulsed high voltage and all involve dynamic\nelectrical discharges, they are governed by EQS laws.\nThe power transmission system is at high voltage and therefore might nat\nurally be regarded as EQS. Certainly, specification of insulation performance (K)\nbegins with EQS approximations. However, once electrical breakdown has occurred,\nenough current can be faulted to bring MQS considerations into play. Certainly,\nthey are present in the operation of highpower switch gear. To be even a fraction of\na wavelength at 60 Hz, a line must stretch the length of California. Thus, in so far\nas the power frequency fields are concerned, the system is quasistatic. But certain\naspects of the power line itself are MQS, and others EQS, although when lightning\nstrikes it is likely that neither approximation is appropriate.\nNot all fields in our bodies are of physiological origin. The man standing\nunder the power line (L) finds himself in both electric and magnetic fields. How is\nit that our bodies can shield themselves from the electric field while being essentially\ntransparent to the magnetic field without having obvious effects on our hearts or\nnervous systems? We will find that currents are indeed induced in the body by both\nthe electric and magnetic fields, and that this coupling is best understood in terms\nof the quasistatic fields. By contrast, because the wavelength of an electromagnetic\nwave at TV frequencies is on the order of the dimensions of the body, the currents\ninduced in the person standing in front of the TV antenna at A are not quasistatic.\n\nSec. 3.6\nSummary\nAs we make our way through the topics outlined in Fig. 3.5.1, these and other\nphysical situations will be taken up by the examples.\n3.6 SUMMARY\nFrom a mathematical point of view, the summary of quasistatic laws given in Table\n3.6.1 is an outline of the next seven chapters.\nAn excursion down the left column and then down the right column of the\noutline represented by Fig. 1.0.1 carries us down the corresponding columns of the\ntable. Gauss' law and the requirement that E be irrotational, (3.2.5a) and (3.2.6a),\nare the subjects of Chaps. 4-5. In Chaps. 6 and 7, two types of charge density\nare distinguished and used to represent the effects of macroscopic media on the\nelectric field. In Chap. 6, where polarization charge is used to represent insulating\nmedia, charge is automatically conserved. But in Chap. 7, where unpaired charges\nare created through conduction processes, the charge conservation law, (3.2.7a),\ncomes into play on the same footing as (3.2.5a) and (3.2.6a). In stages, starting in\nChap. 4, the ability to predict selfconsistent distributions of E and ρ is achieved\nin this last EQS chapter.\nAmp ere's law and magnetic flux continuity, (3.2.5b) and (3.2.6b), are featured\nin Chap. 8. First, the magnetic field is determined for a given distribution of current\ndensity. Because current distributions are often controlled by means of wires, it is\neasy to think of practical situations where the MQS source, the current density, is\nknown at the outset. But even more, the first half of Chap. 7 was already devoted\nto determining distributions of \"stationary\" current densities. The MQS current\ndensity is always solenoidal, (3.2.5c), and the magnetic induction on the right in\nFaraday's law, (3.2.7b), is sometimes negligible so that the electric field can be\nessentially irrotational. Thus, the first half of Chap. 7 actually starts the sequence\nof MQS topics. In the second half of Chap. 8, the magnetic field is determined\nfor systems of perfect conductors, where the source distribution is not known until\nthe fields meet certain boundary conditions. The situation is analogous to that\nfor EQS systems in Chap. 5. Chapters 9 and 10 distinguish between effects of\nmagnetization and conduction currents caused by macroscopic media.

Kirtley Jr.\nSeptember 19, 2010\nIntroduction\nIn this short note we describe a method for calculating forces of electrical and magnetic origin. This\nmethod, sometimes called \"The Principal of Virtual Work\" (POVW) derives from the First Law of\nThermodynamics (conservation of energy), and should be fairly intuitive. The method succeeds in\nmany cases where other methods are difficult or unwieldy to use, but we can show (and do here)\nthat in some cases that are straightforward to work, the results of POVW are consistent with direct\ncalculation of force using fields and charges or the Lorentz Force Law.\nElectromechanical energy converters such as motors, generators, loudspeakers, and so forth are\ndescribed conceptually in Figure 1. Electric power goes in one side (wires), the intended output\n(mechanical power) goes out the other (in the case of a motor, this is the shaft), and then there\nare attendant losses that must be accounted for. In electric motors those losses come out as heat\nfrom resistive drops in the wires, as heat from friction and windage, as noise from vibration and\nunintended torques and from turbulence in the air gap, and from other mechanisms that we won't\ndeal with here.\nThe key to the POVW method for estimating forces is to isolate the force producing mechanisms,\nidentify the energy going into the electromagnetic fields and then identifying how that energy varies\nwith the mechanical variables such as position.\nForce and Potential Energy\nConsider the situation shown in Figure 2. Were we to lift a weight with mass M from a position\non the floor to some position above the floor of height x (with respect to the floor), we would have\nto overcome the gravity force Fg = Mg, where g is called the 'acceleration due to gravity', and\nthis amounts to about 9.812 Newtons per kilogram near the surface of the earth. To lift the mass\n∗⃝c 2010 James L.

We know that, were we able to identify the electric fields\nacting on all of the charges of this system we could use the fact that force on a charge is:\nF =\n\nqE\nSimply adding up all of the forces on the individual charges should give us the total force\nproduced by the system. This may or may not be straightforward, and it is usually not.\n\nElectric\nField\nSystem\n+\nv\n-\nx\ni\nf e\nFigure 3: Conceptual Electric Field System\nFigure 3 shows, conceptually, the kind of system we will be working with. The system has one\nset of electrical terminals, characterized by voltage and current, and one set of mechanical terminals,\ncharacterized by a force and a displacement. Note that in this picture, the force is imposed by the\nelectrical system on whatever it might be driving, while the electrical terminals show power flow\ninto the electric field system.\nPower flow into the system is voltage times current:\ndq\nPe = vi = v dt\nwhere q is charge stored in the system.\nWe can identify the mechanical flow of energy out of this system through the mechanical ter-\nminals is force times velocity.\ndx\nPm = feu = fe dt\nOne caution we must state at this point is that all systems of the type we are dealing with will\nhave losses. Electrical losses will be incurred because dielectrics are 'leaky', so some of that charge\nwill be lost by conduction. Similarly, there will be mechanical losses due to friction. However,\nwe can always identify the 'conservative' part of the system, the lossless part, and we claim (you\nshould examine this claim carefully!) that it is the conservative part that makes the force of electric\norigin, so that losses can be identified separately. Some reflection on this should reveal that the\nnotion of a 'conservative' system is equivalent to the notion that there is a uniquely defined state of\nthe system determined by the two variables, in this case the charge q and the mechanical position\nvariable x. That is:\nWe = We(q, x)\nIf this stored energy is a function only of the state of the system, it is independent of how the\nsystem got to that state. Once the electrical power input to the system and mechanical power\noutput from the system have been identified, it is possible to calculate the rate of change of energy\nstored in the electric field system:\ndWe\ndq\nx\n= Pe\nPm = v\n-f e d\n-\ndt\ndt\ndt\nThen the change in energy between any two states of the system, call them a and b would be:\na\ndq\ndx\na\nWe(a) -We(b) =\nZ\nv\ndt -fe\ndt =\nb\ndt\ndt\nZ\nvdq -fedx\nb\n\nB\nx\nw\nA\nFigure 4: Difference in Energy is Independent of Path Between Points\nThis is just like noting the change in energy stored by that weight in the gravity example is\nWg(a)-Wg(b) =\nR a\nb Mgdx. In the case of the electric field system, however, it is a two-dimensional,\nor vector integral.\nNote that if the energy stored in the electric field system is uniquely determined by the two\nvariables, charge and displacement (q and x), the rate of change of energy stored in the field is:\ndW\n∂W dq\n∂W e\ne\ne\ndx\n=\n+\ndt\n∂q dt\ndx\ndt\nClearing the derivatives, we can find the total differential of energy stored:\ndW e\n∂We\n∂We\n=\ndq +\ndx\n∂q\n∂x\nComparing the two expressions for the differentials of energy, we must come to the conclusion\nthat:\n∂We\n∂We\nv =\nfe = -\n∂q\n∂x\n3.1\nSimple example: Capacitor with Variable Spacing\nAs an example of this force determination, consider a capacitor consisting of two metal plates\nseparated by a variable spacing g, as shown in Figure 5. We know that the capacitance of this\nthing is:\no0WH\nC =\ng\n\ng\nH\nI\n+\n-\nV\nW\nFigure 5: Force Between Capacitor Plates\nSo that the voltage can be expressed as a simple function of charge:\nq\nqg\nv =\n=\nC\no0WH\nTo find energy stored in this thing, assume that the position x is fixed with no charge on the\nplates, so that no work must be done to position it. Then when the charge is Q:\nQ\nQ\nqg\n1 Q2g\nWe =\nZ\nvdq =\nZ\ndq =\no0WH\n2 o0WH\nAccording to our analysis, the force acting on the gap is:\n∂We\nQ2\nfe = -\n= -\n∂x\n2 o0WH\nThis force can be seen to be trying to make the dimensional variable g smaller (negative force).\nThis could be made a bit more tractable by noting that total charge is, in terms of voltage V :\no0WHV\nQ = o0WHEx =\ng\nAnd then the force is easily written in terms of voltage as:\n1 o0WHV 2\nfe = -2\ng2\n3.2\nReconciliation with charge times electric field\nWe should be able to show that the energy method gives the same answer as multiplying charge\ntimes electric field.\nThe situation can be demonstrated by looking a bit more closely at the capacitor. It will help\nto think about the units of charge. The charge on the capacitor plates (positive on the left, negtive\n\n-\ns\nσs\ng\nE\nCapacitor Plates\nσ\nFigure 6: Details of Capacitor Plates\non the right) is Q, which has units of Coulombs. If we can assume that this charge is distributed\nuniformly over the plates, we would have a surface charge density, with units of Coulombs per\nsquare meter:\nQ\nσs = WH\nFigure 6 shows a small section of the capacitor. We assume here that the plates are parallel to\neach other. Since the plates are made of a metal, any electric field must be perpendicular to the\nsurface. If the horizontal direction in Figure 6 is noted as x, then the electric field in the gap must\nbe:\nV\nσ\n\ns\nE = xˆ\n= xˆ\ng\no0\nSimply multiplying surface charge times electric field would yield an expression that is actually\ntwice the real force.\nWe know that the force on a single charge q is fe =\n\nqE, for which the units are Newtons.\nConsequently the volume force on a charge density is F =\n\nρE, for which the units are Newtons\nper cubic meter. Our difficulty here is that the field E arises from the surface charge σs, and that\nsurface charge is a singularity. To resolve this we engage in what is not exactly a ruse, as shown\nin Figure 7. In this picture, we assume that the charge is distributed over a volume, resolving the\nsingularity. That volume charge (units are Coulombs per cubic meter) is:\nQ\nσs\nρ =\n=\nδWH\nδ\nGiven this distribution of charge over a volume, we no longer have a singularity and it is\nstraightforward to estimate electric field as a continuous function of space. As shown in Figure 8,\nlooking at the charge and electric field about the left-hand plate, the field is zero at the metal\nsurface but rises over the assumed charge distribution:\nσs\nEx(x) =\nx\no0δ\n\nx\n-ρ\n+ρ\nδ\nE\nFigure 7: Charge distributed over a volume\nNote that as the assumed dimension δ becomes smaller, the slope of field magnitude increases,\nbut the electric field in the gap (to the right of the charge is independent of the dimension δ.\nVolume force density is\nF =\n\nρE = xˆ\nσ\ns\nx\no0δ\n\nTotal force is directly calculatee by integrating over the volume of the charge distribution:\nδ\nσ\n\ns\nσ2\ns\nf = WH\nZ\nxˆ\n\no0δ\n\nxdx = WH\n2o0\nAs we expect, the actual value assumed for the thickness of the current distribution is im-\nmaterial.\nThe answer is also consistent with what we computed from the Principal of Virtual\nWork.\nForces in Magnetic Field Systems\nBy 'Magnetic Field Systems' we mean magnetoquasistatic systems, in which charges do not accu-\nmulate and time variations of electric fields are not important sources of magnetic field. Consider\na magnetic field system with one electrical terminal pair and one mechanical terminal, as shown in\nFigure 9.\nAs with the electric field system, all converters have loss mechanisms and so are not themselves\nconservative. However, the magnetic field system that produces force is, in principle, conservative\nin the sense that its state and stored energy can be described by only two variables. The 'history'\nof the system, meaning the path by which it was put into its current state is not important.\n\nρ\nσs\nEx\nδ\nε\nFigure 8: Electric Field Developed from Distributed Charge\ne\nMagnetic\nField\nSystem\n+\nv\n-\nx\ni\nf\nFigure 9: Conceptual Magnetic Field System\nIt is possible to chose the variables in such a way that electrical power into this conservative\nsystem is:\ndλ\nPe = vi = i dt\nSimilarly, mechanical power out of the system is:\ndx\nPm = fe dt\nThe difference between these two is the rate of change of energy stored in the system:\ndWm = P -\ne\nPm\ndt\nIt is then possible to compute the change in energy required to take the system from one state to\nanother by:\na\nWm(a) -Wm(b) =\nZ\nidλ -fedx\nb\nwhere the two states of the system are described by a = (λa, xa) and b = (λb, xb)\n\nIf the energy stored in the system is described by two state variables, λ and x, the total\ndifferential of stored energy is:\n∂Wm\n∂Wm\ndWm =\ndλ +\ndx\n∂λ\n∂x\nand it is also:\ndWm = idλ -f edx\nSo that we can make a direct equivalence between the derivatives and:\nf e\n∂Wm\n= -∂x\nThis generalizes in the case of multiple electrical terminals and/or multiple mechanical termi-\nnals. For example, a situation with multiple electrical terminals will have:\ndWm =\nX\ni\n-\nkdλk\nfedx\nk\nAnd the case of rotary, as opposed to linear, motion has in place of force fe and displacement\nx, torque Te and angular displacement θ.\nIn many cases we might consider a system which is electricaly linear, in which case inductance\nis a function only of the mechanical position x.\nλ(x) = L(x)i\nIn this case, assuming that the energy integral is carried out from λ = 0 (so that the part of the\nintegral carried out over x is zero),\nWm =\nZ λ\n1 λ2\nλdλ =\n0 L(x)\n2 L(x)\nThis makes\nf =\n2 ∂\n-\ne\nλ\n∂x L(x)\nNote that this is numerically equivalent to\nfe =\ni2 ∂L(x)\n∂x\nThis is true only in the case of a linear system. Note that substituting L(x)i = λ too early in the\nderivation produces erroneous results: in the case of a linear system it produces a sign error, but\nin the case of a nonlinear system it is just wrong.\n4.1\nExample: Junkyard Magnet\nThis is a practical application of the POVW as applied to magnetic field systems, and the example\nitself is a practical example of a magnetic actuator. You may have seen one of these things picking\nup cars in junkyards.\nA cartoon view of the device is shown in Figure 10. The shaded volumes are highly permeable\nmaterial (μ →inf). They are uniform in shape in the direction perpendicular to the view with\n\ng\nI\nN Turns\nW\nDepth D\nFigure 10: Cartoon of a junkyard magnet\ndimension D. Wrapped arount the upper body is a coil with N turns. That coil is driven with\na DC (constant) current of magnitude I. To find flux, consider Ampere's Law around the loop\nindicated as a dotted line.\nI\nH ·\ndl= NI\nIf magnetic field H is taken to be down in the right-hand gap and up in the left hand gap, and\nif the gap dimension g is relatively small so the field is uniform over the gap area, and since there\nis no magnetic field H in the magnetic material the field in the gap is:\nNI\nHg = 2g\nNote that, since magnetic flux has no divergence, the flux leaving the right-hand pole of the\nupper magnetic body must be matched by flux entering that body in the left-hand pole. Total flux\nis flux density times area:\nNI\nΦ = μ0WD 2g\nand since flux linked by the coil is just NΦ, the inductance of the system is:\nN 2WD\nLg(g) = μ0\n2g\nMagnetic stored energy is:\nWm =\nZ λ0\nλ\nλ2\ndλ =\nLg(g)\n2 Lg(g)\n\nForce acting between the two elements would then be:\nλ2\nμ\n0 ∂\n0I2N WD\nfe = -\n= -\n2 ∂g Lg(g)\n2g2\nThe expression for force is negative as it is in the direction of making the gap smaller.\nIt should be clear that viewing this problem as linear leads to major limitations: the force cannot,\nas suggested by this expression, go to infinity as g →0. Note that it is possible to express the lifting\nforce in terms of the magnetic flux density in the air-gaps: See that, since λ0 = NΦ = NWDBg,\nlift force can be written as:\nB2\ng\nfe = 2WD2μ0\nAs it turns out, this is an accurate description of the lift force, this time in terms of the magnetic\nfield in the gap. If the gap is small enough or the excitation current is large enough, the magnetic\nmaterial will exhibit saturation and the flux density will approach a constant value (in common\nsteels, te saturation flux density is about 1.8 T).\n4.2\nExample: Linear Actuator\nThis example is related to common 'solenoid actuators' that are widely used in relays, motor\nstarters, circuit breakers and the like. The actual form of such actuators is not quite what is shown\nin Figure 11, but the analysis is nearly the same. A flat bar of highly permeable (ferromagnetic)\nmaterial can slide into a gap in a ferromagnetic core. The permeability of both the bar and the\ncore is large enough that we do not need to consider it (μ →inf).\nW\nμ\nI\nN turns\nx\nh\ng\nDepth D\nFigure 11: Cartoon of a linear actuator\nThe inductance of this device is:\nW -x\nx\nw\nL(x) = μ0N 2D\n\n+\ng\ng -h\n\n= μ0N 2D\n\nx\n\n-\ng -h\ng\n\n+ g\n\nMagnetic Stored Energy is\n\nλ\nW\nZ λ0\nλ\nm =\ndλ =\nL(x)\n2 L(x)\nForce developed is then:\n∂Wm\n∂\nλ\n∂L\n)\nf\n(x\n-\n-\ne =\n=\nλ\n=\n∂x\n0 ∂x L(x)\n\nL(x)\n\n∂x\nIf the system is driven by a current I, this has a simple form:\nI2 ∂L(x)\n\nfe =\n= μ0N DI\n-\n∂x\ng -h\ng\n\n4.3\nExample: Railgun\nThis seemingly exotic device has practical applications, not only as a weapon but also for some\ntypes of materials testing. It has an advantage over gas powered guns (the conventional type that\nderive the gas from an explosive charge) that means it can drive very high speed projectiles. We\nintroduce it here because it allows us to show a few important concepts.\nDepth D\nI\nx\nu\nL\nw\nFigure 12: Cartoon of a Rail Gun\nA cartoon of the basic rail gun is shown in Figure 12. It consists of two flat 'rails' that are\nparallel to each other and separated by the distance w, driven at one end by a distributed source of\ncurrent. The system has depth D in the direction you cannot see. Allowed to slide in the horizontal\ndirection is the projectile, which makes good electrical contact with the two rails.\nIt is a common assumption that magnetic field is important only within the region between\nthe two rails. This will be close to being right if D >> w or if the magnetic flux is returned by\na ferromagnetic barrel (not shown in this cartoon). However, this assumption means that we may\nestimate the magnetic field in the region to the left of the projectile to be:\nI0\nHz = -D\nFlux to the left of the projectile is Φ = μ I0\nwx, and because this is inherently a one-turn\nD\ninductor, we can estimate the inductance that is a function of projectile position:\nwx\nL(x) = μ0 D\n\nFrom the derivation of force, recognizing this thing is linear,\nfe =\nI2 ∂L(x)\nw\n=\nμ0I2\n∂x\n0 D\nThe advantage over a gas gun should be clear by now: The force on the projectile depends on\nthe square of current. In a gas gun the pressure behind the projectile falls rapidly as the volume\nbehind the projectile increases.\nNote that this description was incomplete in an inconsequential way: in calculating inductance\nwe included only the region behind (to the left in this picture) of the projectile. The projectile itself\nhas some dimension and there will be some energy stored and so inductance associated with the\nprojectile itself. However, that inductance does not change with projectile position and so does not\naffect action of the railgun. That dimension does, however, allow us to compare the force derived\nby the energy (POVW) method with the Lorentz Force Law.

Kirtley Jr.\nSeptember 4, 2010\nIntroduction\nIn this chapter we describe an equivalence between electric and magnetic circuits and in turn a\nmethod of describing and analyzing magnetic field systems which can be described in magnetic\ncircuit fashion. As it turns out, the equivalence is a fair approximation to reality and may be used\nwith some confidence.\nMagnetic circuits are those parts of devices that employ magnetic flux to either induce voltage or\nproduce force. Such devices include transformers, motors, generators and other actuators (including\nthings such as solenoid actuators and loudspeakers). In such devices it is necessary to produce\nand guide magnetic flux. This is usually done with pieces of ferromagnetic material (which has\npermeability very much larger than free space). In this sense, magnetic circuits are like electric\ncircuits in which conductive material such as aluminum or copper has high electric conductivity\nand are used to guide electric current.\nThe analogies between electric and magnetic circuits are two: the electric circuit quantity of\ncurrent is analogous to magnetic circuit quantity flux. (Both of these quantities are 'solenoidal' in\nthe sense that they have no divergence). The electric circuit quantity of voltage, or electomotive\nforce (EMF) is analogous to the magnetic circuit quantity of magnetomotive force (MMF). EMF\nis the integral of electric field E, MMF is the integral of magnetic field H.\nElectric Circuits and Kirchoff's Laws\n2.1\nConservation of Charge and KCL\nTo begin with, consider the law of Conservation of Charge:\nZ\n⃝\nZ\nd\nJ · da = dt\nZ\nqdv = 0\nvol\n∗⃝c 2003 James L. Kirtley Jr.\n\nThis assumes, of course, that there is no accumulation of charge anywhere in the system. This\nis not a wonderful assumption for any systems with capacitor plates, but if one considers capacitors\nto be circuit elements so that both plates of a capacitor are part of any given element the right\nhand side of this expression really is zero.\nThsn, if we note current to be the integral of current density: Over some area, a fraction of the\nwhole area around a node:\nik =\nZZ\n\nAkJ · da\nthen we have:\nX\nik = 0\nk\n2.2\nFaraday's Law\n:\nI\nd\n\nE · dl= -dt\nZZ\nB · da\nThe left-hand integral may be taken to be a number of sub-integrals, each denoted by a discrete\nfractional integral:\nvk =\nZ bk E · dl\nak\nIf we assume that there are no substantive flux linkages among the circuit elements:\nZZ\nB = 0\nthen we have KVL:\nX\nvk = 0\nk\n2.3\nOhm's Law\nAt this point it is probably appropriate to note that Ohm's Law can be used to derive the consti-\ntutive relationship for a resistor. Suppose we have a conductive element similar to the rectangular\nsolid shown in Figure 1. Assume current is confined in this element and flowing perpendicular to\nthe flat end shown in the figure. Current density is\nI\nJx = hw\nwhere I is to total current and h and w are height and width of the conductor, respectively.\nElectric field along the length of the element is:\nJx\nEx = σ\n\nwhere σ is the electrical conductivity of the material. Voltage developed is:\nJx\nvk =\nZ\nExdl=\nl\nσ\nWhich leads us to an expression for element resistance:\nv\nl\nR =\n=\nI\nhwσ\nw\nl\nx\nI\nh\n-\n+\nV\nFigure 1: Simple circuit element\nMagnetic Circuits\nAs it turns out, magnetic circuits are very similar and are governed by laws that are not at all\ndifferent from those of electric circuits, with only one minor difference.\n3.1\nConservation of Flux: Gauss' Law\nTo start, Gauss' law is:\nZ\n⃝\nZ\nB · da = 0\nThis reflects that notion that there are no sources of flux: this is a truely sinusoidal quantity.\nIt neither begins nor ends but just goes in circles.\nIf we note a fraction of the surface around a node and call it surface k, the flux through that\nsurface is:\nΦk =\nZZ\n\nAkB · da\nIf we take the sum of all partial fluxes through a surface surrounding a note we come to the\nanalog of KCL:\nX\nΦk = 0\nk\n\n3.2\nMMF: Ampere's Law\nAmpere's Law is simply stated as:\nI\nH · dl=\nZZ\nJ · da\nThe integral of current density J is current, quantified in the SI system as Amperes. As it is\ngenerally carried in wires which might number, say , N, it is often quantified as:\nZZ\nJ · da = NI\nFor this we will often use the term MagnetoMotive Force or MMF, which gets the symbol F. If\nwe use that symbol to denote the integral of magnetic field over a magnetic circuit element:\nbk\n=\nZ\n\nFk\nH · dl\nak\nThen, if we take enough of these subintegrals to cover the loop around a group of elements, we\nhave\nX\nFk = NI\nk\nNote that this is not exactly the same as KVL, as it has a source term on the right.\n3.3\nMagnetic Circuit Element: Analogy to Ohm's Law\nMagnetic circuits have an equivalent to resistance. It is the ratio of MMF to flux and has the\nsymbol R. I direct comparison with the derivation of resistance, a magnetic circuit element is\nshown in Figure 2.\nw\nl\nx\nh\n-\n+\nF\nΦ\nFigure 2: Magnetic circuit element\nAssume that the material of this element has permeability μ > μ0, so that it has a constitutive\nrelationship:\n\nBx = μHx\nIf flux density in the material is uniform, total flux through the element is:\nΦ = hwBx = hwμHx\nAnd the MMF is simply the integral of magnetic field H from one end to the other: again we\nassume uniformity so that:\nF = lHx\nThe reluctance of this element is then:\nF\nl\nR =\n=\nΦ\nhwμ\n3.4\nMagnetic Gaps\nIn reality, magnetic circuits tend to be made up of very highly permeable elements (pieces of iron)\nand relatively small air-gaps. A sketch of such a gap is shown in Figure 3.\nμ\nμ\ng\nh\nw\nFigure 3: Gap between magnetic elements\nIt is usually permissible to assume that iron elements have very high permeability (μ →inf), so\nthat there is negligible MMF drop. In this sense the iron elements serve in the same role as copper\nor aluminum wire in electric circuits. The gap, on the other hand, has reluctance:\ng\nRg = hwμ0\n\nμ\nμ\nH\nH\na\nm\nBg\nBm\nFringing Field\nFigure 4: Gap details\n3.5\nBoundary Conditions\nShown in Figure 4 is the cross-section of a gap. It is assumed that the elements shown have some\ndepth into the paper which is greater than the gap width g. If the permeability of the elements to\nthe right and the left is very high, we say that magnetic flux is largely confined to those elements.\nNote that the boundary condition associated with Ampere's Law dictates that the magnetic field\nintensity Ha in the air adjacent to the permeable material and parallel with the surface must be\nequal to the magnetic field intensity Hm just inside the magnetic material and parallel with the\nsurface. If the material is very highly permeable (μ →inf), that magnetic field must be nearly zero:\nHa = Hm →0. This means that magnetic field must be perpendicular to the surface of very highly\npermeable material. This is the case in the gap itself, where:\nBg = Bm\nWe should note, however, that there will be 'fringing' fields in the region near the gap, so that our\nexpression for the reluctance of the gap will not be quite correct. The accuracy of the expression\nwhich ignores fringing is best for really small gaps and generally over-estimates the reluctance.\nFaraday's Law and Inductance\nChanging magnetic fields give rise to electric fields and consequently produce voltage. This is how\ninductance works. Consider the situation shown rather abstractly in Figure 5.\nFaraday's Law is, in integral form:\nI\nd\n\nE · dl= -dt\nZZ\nB · nda\nArea\nIf the contour shown is highly conducting (say, if it is a wire), there is zero electric field over\nthat part of the contour. Voltage across the terminals is:\nVab =\nZ b E · dl\na\nand that is the whole of the integral above. Thus we may conclude that:\n\nV\n+\n-\ndl\nn\nb\na\ni\nFigure 5: Loop for Faraday's Law\nd\nVab = -\nZZ\nB · nda\nArea\ndt\nNow, if we define flux linked by this contour to be:\n=\nZZ\n\nλ\n-\nB · nda\nArea\nthen voltage is, as we expect:\ndλ\nVab = dt\nAs it turns out, current flowing in the wire with sense shown by i in Figure 5 tends to produce\nflux with sense opposite to the normal vector shown in that figure, and so produces positive flux.\nGenerally, in calculating inductance, one uses the 'right hand rule' in determing the direction of\nflux linkage: if the fingers of your right hand follow the direction of the winding, from the positive\nterminal, positive flux is in the direction of your thumb.\n4.1\nExample: Solenoid Actuator\nShown in Figure 6 is a representation of a common solenoid actuator. When current is put through\nthe coil a magnetic flux appears in the gaps and pulls the plunger to the left. We will examine the\nforce and how to calculate it in later chapters. For now, however, we are concerned with magnetic\nfields in the device and with the calculation of inductance. Assume that the stator and plunger\nare both made of highly permeable materials (μ →inf). If the coil carries current I in N turns in\nthe sense shown, magnetic flux will cross the narrow air-gap to the right in the direction from the\nstator to the plunger and then return in the sense shown in the variable length gap of width x. It\nis clear that this is also positive sense flux for the coil.\nThe magnetic circuit equivalent is shown in Figure 7.\nAll of the flux produced crosses the\nvariable width gap which has reluctance:\n\nNI\nB\nw\nμ\nDepth D perpendicular to view\nh\nx\nCoil\ng\nStator\nPlunger\nFigure 6: Cross-Section of Solenoid Actuator\nF\nΦ\ng\ng\nx\nFigure 7: Magnetic Equivalent Circuit of Solenoid Actuator\nx\nRx = μ0hD\nHalf of the flux crosses each of the other two gaps, which are in parallel and have reluctance:\ng\nRg = μ0wD\nTotal flux in the magnetic circuit is\nF\nΦ = Rx + 1\n2Rg\nAnd since λ = NΦ and F = NI, the inductance of this structure is:\nN 2\nN 2\nL =\n=\nR\nRx + 1\n2Rg\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n6.007 Electromagnetic Energy: From Motors to Lasers\nSpring 2011\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

      "content": "MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\n6.007 - Applied Electromagnetics\nFall 2007\nSign Conventions in Electromagnetic (EM) Waves\nby Scott Bradley\nOh, the signs! You may have already encountered some confusion regarding the signs in your homework\nregarding dissipation of electromagnetic waves. There were several instances of sign confusion in the problem\nsets and lecture notes, so we apologize for the confusion and will attempt to clarify the issue.\nThere is actually a difference between physics texts (dealing with general EM, lasers, and all sorts of atomic\nradiation interactions) and electrical engineering (EE) texts (mostly dealing with antenna theory, where\nelectrical engineers have historically been most prevalent in encountering radiation) in the various definitions\nof complex dielectric function, complex index of refraction, etc.\nFor example, in physics texts, you'll see the complex index of refraction listed as:\nn = n + iκ\nHowever, in electrical engineering texts (such as the 6.013 course notes), you'll see the index of refraction\nlisted as:\nn = n -jκ\nEvidently, from these two treatments, it seems that i = -j. This is somewhat true in a bizarre way, at least\nfor EM phasor terminology, which we'll elucidate below. BUT, this is not a hard and fast convention. Some\ntexts may confuse the two uses, using i and j interchangeably, so we'll show you how to consistently handle\nsigns.\nThe confusion comes from the initial choice of phasor rotation direction with increasing time, which ultimately\ndecides all the signs in the system.\nChoice of phasor rotation direction\nIf we have a wave defined by:\nEy = E0 cos(ωt -βz)\n(1)\nwe can also define this wave using Euler's Theorem:\nE\nEy =\n\nei(ωt-βz) + e-i(ωt-βz)\n(2)\nYou'll sometimes see equation (2) written as:\nE\nEy =\n\nei(ωt-βz) + c.c.\nor\n\nE0\nE\ni(ωt\nβz)\ny =\ne-\n-\n+ c.c.\nwhere the \"c.c.\" stands for \"complex conjugate.\"\n\nEquations (1) and (2) are equivalent and will have only real parts when evaluated. In linear systems, we\ngenerally don't carry around the extra baggage of the complex conjugate, since we can equivalently just\nrepresent Ey by one of the two terms from equation (2) and take the real part, as we've done in class, giving\nEy represented by:\nE\ni(ωt\nβz)\ny = Re\n\nE0e\n-\n\n(3)\n\n6.007 Fall 2007\nSign Conventions in Electromagnetic (EM) Waves\nor\nE = Re\n\nE e-i(ωt\ny\n-βz)\n(4)\nwhere \"Re\" means taking the real part of the complex value in the parenthesis.\nThis is where the confusion about the signs comes in. Do we use equation (3) or (4)?\nMathematically, the difference between equations (3) and (4) is the direction of rotation of the phasor in the\ncomplex plane with increasing time. Figure 1 shows this for a phasor x .\nIm{x}\nRe{x}\nx=eiωt\nx=e-iωt\nincreasing time\nincreasing time\nFigure 1: Graphical representation of phasor x . Depending on the sign of the exponent, increasing\ntime will cause the phasor to rotate clockwise (-i) or counterclockwise (+i).\nIn electrical engineering, you'll usually see electromagnetic waves represented using equation (3); in physics,\nequation (4) is preferred.\nEffect of choice on index of refraction definition\nGoing back to equation (2), if we want to add some sort of dissipation which causes the magnitude of the\nelectric field to decrease as the wave travels further in +zˆ, we represent this mathematically as:\nE\nEy = e-αz\nei(ωt-βz) + e-i(ωt-βz)\n(5)\n\nwhere α has units of inverse distance, or m-= 1/m. We are specifying here that α > 0 corresponds\nto the case of dissipation.\n\n6.007 Fall 2007\nSign Conventions in Electromagnetic (EM) Waves\nIf we combine terms, placing -αz in the two complex exponentials, we get:\nE\nE =\nei(ωt-βz+iαz) + e-i(ωt\nβ\ny\n-z-iαz)\nE\n=\nei(ωt-(β-iα)z) + e-i(ωt-(β+iα)z\n\n)\n\n(6)\nEquation (6) shows two different possible definitions for the complex wavevector, β . If you use the first term\n(EE definition) in equation (6), then β is given by:\nβ = β -iα\n(7)\nIf you use the second term (physics definition) in equation (6), you get:\nβ = β + iα\n(8)\nThis then leads straightforwardly to the two different definitions for the index of refraction since β = n ω\nc , or\nn = c β\nω .\nUsing the EE definition:\nc\nn =\n(β\nω\n-iα)\n(9)\n= n -iκ\nUsing the physics definition:\nc\nn =\n(β + iα)\n(10)\nω\n= n + iκ\nSince we typically use j instead of i in electrical engineering, you typically see equation (9) written as:\nc\nn =\n(β\nω\n-jα)\n= n -jκ\nhence resulting in the \"equivalence\" of i = -j, which really only means that physicists and electrical engineers\nuse different phasor notation for their EM waves.\nSome other effects of the choice of phasor representation\nOne mistake in Problem Set 6 that you may have noticed when trying to solve problem #4 was that using\nthe given Lorentz oscillator model equation, the wave in silicon did not dissipate but rather was amplified\nas it traveled to larger z.\nThis was due to an incorrect sign in the Lorentz oscillator model equation given. The one in the problem\nset was:\nω2\nεr(ω) = 1 +\np\nω2\n0 -ω2 -iωγ\nThis version of the Lorentz model equation is derived by representing the polarization in the medium\nas:\nP(z, t) = P(ω, z)e-iωt\nwhich, when differentiated in the derivation, gives a factor -iω.\n\n6.007 Fall 2007\nSign Conventions in Electromagnetic (EM) Waves\nThe use of -iωt, which is from the physics phasor notation, means that we inadvertently combined the\nphysics and electrical engineering notations, which will result in sign errors.\nThe Lorentz model equation we should have used would have been derived using:\nP(z, t) = P(ω, z)ejωt\nwhich would have then given us a version of the Lorentz model consistent with the EE phasor representation\nof the E-field of the electromagnetic wave:\nω2\nεr(ω) = 1 +\np\nω2\n0 -ω2 + jωγ\nSummary: Which notation to use? Just be consistent!\nIn 6.007, we'll be using the EE notation.\nUltimately, your choice of notation does not matter as long as you are consistent. This notation difference\nbetween physics and EE, along with the different definition of right and left-handed polarization between\nthe two fields, leads to many headaches when trying to learn the material, but it's an unfortunate historical\nreality.\nFor what we've covered in 6.007, below are the consistent representations for EE and physics notation:\nEquation\nElectrical Engineering\nPhysics\nElectric Field\nEy = Re\n\nEyej(ωt- βz)\nEy = Re\n\nEye-i(ωt- βz)\nWavevector, β\nβ = β -jα\nβ = β + iα\nIndex of Refraction, n\nn = n -jκ\nn = n + iκ\nLorentz Model, εr\nεr = 1 +\nω2\np\nω2\n0-ω2+jωγ\nεr = 1 +\nω2\np\nω2\n0-ω2-iωγ\nThe electric field wave shown above is for general cases. The phasor Ey has a magnitude and can have a\nnon-zero phase. A non-zero phase would correspond to cases where the E-field goes not as a pure cosine,\nbut rather as a sine or a mixture of sine and cosine.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n6.007 Electromagnetic Energy: From Motors to Lasers\nSpring 2011\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

The term \"quantum\" comes from the Latin \"quantus\", meaning \"how\nmuch\", and was used by Planck in this context to represent \"counting\" of these elementary\nunits. This idea was exploited by Albert Einstein, who in 1905 showed that EM waves could be\nequivalently treated as corpuscles - later named 'photons' - with discrete, \"quantized\" energy,\nwhich was dependent on the frequency of the wave.\nPrior to the advent of quantum mechanics in the 1900s, the most well-known attempt by a\nclassical physicist to describe the interaction of light with matter in terms of Maxwell's equations\nwas carried out by a Hendrik Lorentz. Despite being a purely classical description, the Lorentz\noscillator model was adapted to quantum mechanics in the 1900s and is still of considerable use\ntoday.\nH. A. Lorentz\n(1853-1928)\nHendrik Antoon Lorentz was a Dutch physicist in the late 19th century, responsible for\nthe derivation of the electromagnetic Lorentz force and the Lorentz transformations, later used\nby Einstein in the development of Special Relativity. Lorentz shared the 1902 Nobel Prize in\nPhysics with Pieter Zeeman for the discovery and theoretical explanation of the Zeeman effect\n(splitting of spectral lines when a static magnetic field is applied).\nIn his attempt to describe the interaction between atoms and electric fields in classical terms,\nLorentz proposed that the electron (a particle with some small mass) is bound to the nucleus of\nthe atom (with a much larger mass) by a force that behaves according to Hooke's Law - that is,\na spring-like force. An applied electric field would then interact with the charge of the electron,\ncausing \"stretching\" or \"compression\" of the spring, which would set the electron into oscillating\nmotion. This is the so-called Lorentz oscillator model.\nPhysical harmonic oscillators\nIn 8.01, 8.02 and 18.03, you analyzed multiple cases of harmonic oscillators. A second-order\nlinear differential equation accurately describes the evolution (with respect to time) of the dis-\nplacement of a mass attached to a spring, with/without a driving force and with/without a\nImage in the public domain.\n\nlinear damping term (due to energy-dissipating forces). An analogous equation applies to reso-\nnant (LC or RLC) circuits. Let us first analyze the simplest case in order to obtain an expression\nfor the resonant frequency.\n2.1\nSimple case and the resonant frequency\nA simple spring oscillator is undriven and undamped. The forces governing the motion of the\nmass are only Newton's 2nd Law and Hooke's Law (for springs that obey a linear relation).\nPutting both together, we obtain the equation for the mass' displacement with respect to time\nfrom the equilibrium position (assuming the system is initially perturbed out of equilibrium to\ninitiate motion).\n1. Hooke's Law: F(y) = -ky, where k is the spring constant and y is the displacement from\nthe equilibrium position\n2. Newton's 2nd Law: F(y) =\nm d y\ndt2\nEquating both:\nd2y\nm\n=\ndt2\n-ky\n(2.1)\nOr equivalently:\nd2y\nk\n= -\ny\n(2.2)\ndt2\nm\nThe solution to this differential equation is a cosine (or a sine), of frequency\nk\nm.\nThat is called the resonant frequency - also called natural frequency or\nq\nfundamental\nfrequency - of an undamped spring-like oscillator.\nLet us call such frequency ω0.\nHence,\nω2\n0 = k\nm, and we can solve for k, yielding k = mω2\n0.\nThe displacement is given by y(t) = A cos(ω0t) + C, where A and C are constants corre-\nsponding to the initial conditions of the system.\n2.2\nGeneral case\nLet us now include a driving force and a damping force. The simplest type of damping we\ncan have is linearly proportional to the velocity of the mass, the force being of the form\nFdamping = -mγ dy\ndt . The driving force can be of any kind, dependent or independent of time\nand displacement. Collecting all the terms, on the left-hand side we still have Newton's 2nd\nLaw, and on the right-hand side we have the summed contribution of all forces - using for the\nspring force the expression for k obtained above.\nd2y\ndy\nm\n= F\n+\n+\n3)\ndrivi\nF\n=\n(2.\nng\ndamping\nFspring\nFdriving -mγ dt -mω0y\ndt\nRearranging the equation:\nd2y\ndy\nm\n+ mγ\n+ mω2\ndt2\ndt\n0y = F\n(2.4)\ndriving\n\nThe Lorentz Oscillator Model\n3.1\nLorentz oscillator equation\nIf we assume the nucleus of the atom is much more massive than the electron, we can treat the\nproblem as if the electron-spring system is connected to an infinite mass, which does not move,\nallowing us to use the mass of the electron, m = 9.11 × 10-31kg. Depending on the case, this\nvalue may be substituted by the reduced or effective electron mass to account for deviations\nfrom this assumption.\nMoreover, the assumption that the binding force behaves like a spring is a justified approxi-\nmation for any kind of binding, given that the displacement is small enough (meaning that only\nthe constant and linear terms in the Taylor expansion are relevant).\nThe damping term comes from internal collisions in the solid and radiation emitted by\nthe electron (any accelerating charge emits radiation, as you will see later in this class). The\nrelevance of the damping term will become clearer in section 4.5. It is also briefly mentioned in\nsection 5.1.\nAll there is left for us to complete the Lorentz oscillator equation is to determine the driving\nforce. In the case of a solid placed in an electric field varying in time with angular frequency ω\nbut independent of the displacement in the y direction, we get:\n-E→\ny(ω, t) = -E-→\n0y cos ωt = Re\n-→\n{Efy(ω, t)} =\n-\nRe\n-→\n{E0yejωt}\n(3.1)\n(with -E-→\n0y real and independent of time)\n-F-\nd\n-\nrivin\n-→\ng =\nqE-→\n-\ny\n(3.2)\nThis practice of writing the cosine as the real part of an exponential - by taking advan-\ntage of ejx = cos(x) + j sin(x), called Euler's formula - is quite common, and its practical\nadvantage will become clear shortly. We've chosen here to make the driving field have zero\nphase arbitrarily-as you will see, if a phase is also present (meaning the field is not purely\n\na cosine function but a mix of sine and cosine), then the time-independent constant (in the\nabove equation, -E-→\n0y) will be complex. A shorthand notation is to drop the ejωt term and the\nRe{} throughout the derivations, and only \"putting them back\" for the final calculation. This\nshorthand approach is called the phasor notation.\nWe have learned two different, but equivalent, formulas for the polarization:\nI. -→\nP = Nδ-→x = Nq(--→y ) = -Nq-→y\n(3.3)\n→The polarization vector is nothing but the density (per volume) of dipole moments,\nwhich in turn are defined simply as the product of the charge and the displacement\nvector from the negative to the positive charge, that is, from the electron to the\nnucleus. We are using q as the notation for the elementary charge, the absolute\nvalue of the charge of the electron (q = 1.602 × 10-19C).\nNote the negative sign in the definition: our spring-mass system displacement vector was taken\nto point to the end of the spring (where the electron sits.) In order to keep the sign convention,\nour dipole displacement is the opposite of the spring-mass displacement.\nII. -→\nP = ε0χe\n-→\nE\n(3.4)\n→The polarization of a material is related to the applied electric field by this quantity\nwe called the material's electric susceptibility: applying an electric field to a\nwide range of materials will cause the electrons in the material to be displaced,\ncreating multiple positive/negative charge dipoles. The more electrically susceptible\nthe material, the larger the displacement and/or the greater the number of dipoles\ncreated, as given by the first definition of the polarization.\nLet us write the general harmonic oscillator equation driven by the an electric field in terms of\nthe electric polarization vector -→\nP .\nFor clarity, the arrows that indicate vector quantities were eliminated and we are working\nexclusively with magnitudes now - given the previously assumed orientations. However, this\ncalculation could be performed in vector form.\nFrom the first definition of the polarization above: y(t) = -P (t)\nNq\nm d y + mγ dy + mω2y\ndt2\ndt\n= Fdriving\n-\nm d P -mγ dP -mω0\nNq dt2\nP\nNq dt\nNq\n= Fdriving\nd P\nN\n2 + γ dP + ω2\nq\n0P = -\nF\ndt\ndt\nm\ndriving\nSubstituting our expression for Fdriving:\nd2P\ndP\nNq2\n+ γ\n+ ω2\n0P =\nEy\n(3.5)\ndt2\ndt\nm\nLet us digress for a bit to introduce a new term.\n\n3.2\nThe plasma frequency\nSimply stated, a plasma is an ionized, electrically conducting gas of charged particles, usually\noccurring under conditions of very high temperature and/or very low particle density.\nPlasmas exhibit many cool effects, as you probably have seen, in aurora (polar light) or in a\nplasma ball.\nMany of these effects take place collectively. One of the most fundamental collective effects\nof a plasma is the plasma oscillation.\nIn equilibrium, the electric fields of the electrons and the ionized nuclei cancel each other\nout, but this equilibrium is hardly maintained.\nInstead of dealing with the individual (chaotic!) motion of electrons and nuclei, consider\nthe center of mass of the nuclei and the center of mass of the electrons. In equilibrium, they\ncoincide. However, when they shift with respect to each other, a Coulomb force arises trying to\nrestore their position, initiating an oscillatory behavior (think of a blob of fluid floating at zero\ngravity). The frequency at which these oscillations resonate is called the plasma frequency.\nThe magnitude of this frequency has highly significant implications with respect to the\npropagation of electromagnetic waves through the plasma.\nPlasma exists naturally in what we call the ionosphere (80 km ∼120 km above the surface\nof the Earth). There, UV light from the Sun ionizes air molecules.\nThere are several ways to determine, or estimate, the plasma frequency, and those are beyond\nthe scope of this short introduction. In 6.007, we will use the simplest and most convenient of\nthem, namely:\nω2\nNq2\np =\n(3.6)\nmε0\nor equivalently\nωp =\ns\nNq2\n(3.7)\nmε0\nNote that the plasma frequency is proportional to the electron density, and can be calculated\nfor any material for which such density is known.\nThe plasma frequency for \"non-plasma\"\nmaterials stands for the natural collective oscillation frequency of the \"sea\" of electrons in the\nmaterial, not of individual dipoles.\nAs before, q stands for the absolute value of the charge of the electron, and m stands for the\nstandard mass of the electron, or sometimes the effective mass.\n12 electrons\nIn the ionosphere, N = 10\n7 rad\nωp\nm3\n, so ωp = 5.64 × 10\nand\ns\nfp = 2π = 9Mhz.\nAs Richard Feynman stated in his \"Lectures of Physics, Vol. II\":\nImage by Jean-Jacques\nMilan, from Wikipedia.\nImage in the public domain.\n\n\"This natural resonance of a plasma has some interesting effects. For example, if\none tries to propagate a radio wave through the ionosphere, one finds that it can\npenetrate only if its frequency is higher than the plasma frequency. Otherwise the\nsignal is reflected back. We must use high frequencies if we wish to communicate\nwith a satellite in space. On the other hand, if we wish to communicate with a\nradio station beyond the horizon, we must use frequencies lower than the plasma\nfrequency, so that the signal will be reflected back to the earth.\"\n3.3\nObtaining permittivity\nWe are now able to complete the model. Recall our differential equation for the polarization:\nd2P(ω, t)\ndP(ω, t)\nNq2\n+ γ\n+ ω2\n0P(ω, t) =\nEy(ω, t)\n(3.8)\ndt2\ndt\nm\nWhere ω is the frequency with witch the electric field varies. We can rewrite the equation\nsubstituting the plasma frequency in the following way:\nd2P(ω, t)\ndP(ω, t)\n+ γ\n+ ω2P(ω, t) = ε0ω2Ey(ω, t)\n(3.9)\ndt2\ndt\np\nSince we chose to work with a sinusoidally-varying electric field, let us make the educated\nassumption that the polarization which solves that equation also varies sinusoidally and is of\nthe form:\nP(ω, t) = P(ω) cos(ωt) = Re{P(ω)ejωt}\n(3.10)\nWith Pe(ω) being independent of time and allowed to\ne\nbe a complex quantity (that is what\nthe ∼stands for) in order to account for any phase-lag between the driving electric field and\nthe polarization.\nAnother way of writing this would be P(ω) = P(ω)ejφP (ω), where φP (ω) is the phase differ-\nence between the electric field and the polar\ndependent on the angular frequency of the\ne\nization vector. This phase difference could also be\nelectric field.\nIncluding the electric field expression from section 2.3.1 and the above expression for the\npolarization in our Lorentz oscillator equation (Re{}'s were eliminated as the variable is now\ncomplex):\nd [Pe(ω)ejωt] +\nd[P\nγ\ne(ω)ejωt] + ω2P(ω)ejωt\ndt2\ndt\n= ε0ω2\npE0yejωt\nTaking derivatives of exponential terms (since P\ne\n(ω) is independent of time):\n(jω)2P(ω)ejωt + jγωP\ne\nThe exponentials can\ne\ncel, and by solv\ne(ω)ejωt + ω2Pe(ω)ejωt = ε ω2E\nejωt\np\n0y\ning for the complex polarization we obtain:\nε\nP(ω) =\n0ω2\np\nE\n(\n(\n0y\nω2\n3.11)\n0 -ω ) + jγω\nBear in mind that through all\ne\nthese derivations, the polarization and electric field are vector\nquantities: arrows are just being omitted to prevent the derivation to become clumsier than\nnecessary.\n\nRecall now the second definition of polarization: -→\nP = ε0χe\n-→\nE\nYou have been introduced to the concept of relative permittivity, also called the dielec-\ntric constant\nε\nε = 1 + χe. We can rewrite the above definition of polarization as:\n-→\nε\nP = ε0(ε0\n-1)-→\nE\n(3.12)\nWe will make a slight modification to accommodate our complex result. Instead of a real ε,\nlet there be a complex eε such that:\n-→\nP (ω) = ε0( eε\n1)-E-→\nε0\n-\n0y\n(3.13)\n(Note: this requires that χ\ne\ne and P(ω) be also complex! Being such, we can call them χe and\nPe(ω))\nCombining this with our previous result:\ne\nε\neε\nω2\n= 1 +\np\n14)\n(ω2\n(3.\n0 -ω2) + jωγ\nThe above equation shows that permittivity depends on the frequency of the electric field,\nbesides the plasma frequency and damping (which are properties of the medium). A medium\ndisplaying such behavior (that is, whose permittivity depends on the frequency of the wave)\nis called dispersive, named after \"dispersion,\" which is the phenomenon exhibited in a prism\nor raindrop that causes white light to be spread out into a rainbow of colors (white light is a\nmixture of beams of many different colors-all traveling at the same speed, but having different\nfrequencies and wavelengths).\n3.4\nQuick review on notation\nJust to get things straight:\n- ε is the electric permittivity of the medium\n- ε0 is the electric permittivity of vacuum\n-\nε\nε\nis the relative electric permittivity of the medium\n- μ is the magnetic permeability of the medium\n- μ0 is the magnetic permeability of vacuum\nμr is the relative magnetic permeability of the medium, and it is equal to\nμ\nμ0\n-\nImage in the public domain, by NASA.\n\n- χm is the magnetic susceptibility of the medium, and μr = 1 + χm\n- χe is the electric susceptibility of the medium, and\nε\nε = 1 + χe\n-→\n- Ey(ω, t) is the time-varying electric field driving the oscillator\nE--→\n-\n0y is the time-independent part of the electric field\n- ω is the angular frequency of the time-varying electric field driving the oscillator\n- ωo is the resonance (angular) frequency of the oscillator\n- ωp is the plasma frequency of the material\n3.5\nFrequency analysis\nSince our electric permittivity is a complex quantity, we can break it down into a real and an\nimaginary part:\nε = εr\nε0\n-jεi\n(3.15)\nFrom this definition, and remembering\ne\nthese quantities are a function of the frequency of the\ndriving electric field, we can obtain the magnitude and phase of the polarization (and hence the\namplitude and phase of the displacement of the oscillator) with respect to the electric field. We\njust need some algebraic manipulation to remove the imaginary number from the denominator\nin equation 3.14:\nω2(ω2\nω)\n-ω2)\nεr(\n-1 =\np\n(ω2\n(3.16)\n-ω2)2\n+ ω γ2\nω2\nεi(ω) =\npγω\n(ω2\n(3.17)\n-ω2\n)2 + ω2γ2\nThe form of equation for εi is often referred to as a \"Lorentzian.\"\no\n\np\n\nNote that since the polarization vector and the electric field are related by the electric\nsusceptibility we should analyze the magnitude and phase of χ\ninstead of ε\neε (the difference being just the -1 term).\ne\nε\ne =( e\njεi\nε\n,\n0 -1) = (εr -1) -\n-→\nP (ω) = ε0χe\n-E-→\n0y\nχe\njφχ (ω)\ne(ω\ne\n) = |χe(ω\ne\n)|e\ne\nThe magnitude is given by:\n|χe(ω)| =\n(εr -1)2 + ε2\ni\n(3.18)\nWith the assumed notation of -E-→\n0y being\nq\na real entity (as opposed to complex), the phase\ndifference between the polarization vector and the electric field will be equal to the phase of the\nthe complex susceptibility, which is given by:\nε\nγ\nφ\n=\ni\nω\nP\nφχe(ω) = arctan(\n) = arctan(\n)\n(3.19)\nεr -1\nω2\n0 -ω\nRemember that -→\nP = -Nq-→y . Therefore, the magnitude of the displacement will be given\nby |-→\n→\n-\ny | = |P |\nqN , and the negative sign contributes with an inversion of phase (φP = -φy).\nTo illustrate, the magnitude of the displacement and its phase (relative to the phase of the\nelectric field) were plotted for a made-up material with N = 1028cm-3, ωp = 1.3\n× 1016 rad\ns ,\nω0 = 6.077\nrad\ns\nand γ = 1.519\n1015 rad\ns , as follows.\n×\n×\n3.5.1\nLow frequencies\nFor ω ≈0:\nεi(0) ≈0\n|χe(0)| ≈|εr -1| ≈\nωp\nω0\nφχe(0) ≈arctan(0) = 0\nTherefore, the amplitude of the displacement is \"medium\" (compared to the peak and to\nzero) and the displacement is in phase with the varying electric field.\n\n3.5.2\nNear the resonant frequency\nFor ω ≈ω0 :\nεr(ω0) -1 ≈0\n|χe(ω0)| ≈|εi| ≈\nωp\nγω0\nφ\nγωo\nπ\nχe(ω0) ≈arctan(\n0 ) ≈arctan(inf) = 2\nHere, the amplitude is much larger than the low frequency scenario (since γ ≪ω0 : if this was\nnot the case, damping would dissipate the energy too fast and prevent motion from occurring).\nThe displacement is 90o out of phase with the electric field.\n3.5.3\nHigh frequencies\nFor ω →inf:\nSince ω shows up to the fourth power in the denominator of both εrand εi and not even his\ncube appears on the numerators, they vanish.\n|χe(inf)| = 0\nφχe(inf) ≈arctan(0) = 0 or π\nTo figure out the phase, we go back to the result derived at the end of section 3.3.\nThe term that dominates the denominator is (-ω2), so the whole thing becomes a tiny, but\nnegative, number. A negative real number has phase equal to 180o.\nHence, the displacement is minimal and it is 180o out of phase with the electric field.\nAs an example of each frequency regime described, an analogy can be made with pushing\nsomeone on a swing at low frequencies, near the resonance frequency, and at high frequencies,\nas shown in the cartoon.\nElectromagnetic Waves\n4.1\nThe 1-D Wave Equation and plane waves\nA physical wave can be described by a partial differential equation called the wave equation.\nLet us consider a general uni-dimensional wave, whose shape is given by a function F(z, t),\npropagating along the z-direction (either towards its positive or negative orientation) with phase\nvelocity vp (which is the propagation velocity for waves of a single frequency. The phase\nvelocity is distinct from the group velocity of a collection of waves that make up a pulse or\nother type of wavepacket.\nThe general wave equation is:\n∂2F =\n∂z2\n1)\nv2\n∂2F\n(4.\np\n∂t2\n\nNote that this same 1-D equation for a uni-dimensional wave also describes a 3-D uniform\nplane wave, only requiring us to request that the value of F at some z0 and t0 - call it F(z0, t0)\n- holds for any x or y, that is, it has the same value F on all of the xy planar slice passing\nthrough z0, perpendicular to the direction of propagation, which contains z0.\nAs shown by mathematician Jean d'Alembert, the general solution to this equation is of the\nform:\nF(z, t) = f+(z -vpt) + f (z + v\n-\npt)\n(4.2)\n(where f+and f are uniform waves moving in the +z and -z directions, respectively)\n-\n( Hint: try applying the partial derivative operators\n∂\n∂t2 and\n∂\n∂z2 to any F(z, t), f+(z -vpt)\nor f (z + v t) in order to verify that they all satisfy the 1-D wave equation)\n-\np\nIt should be noted that the argument of f+ or f\ncan be multiplied (or divided) by a non-zero\n-\nconstant, and those functions would still be solutions to the wave equation. That is, if instead\nof f(z -vpt) we have f(az -avpt), we still get a solution! A particularly useful case happens\nwhen a =\n1 , yielding f\nz\nf\nz\n+\nt\nt\nv\n( v -) and\n( v + ). This case will be further explored in section\np\np\n-\n4.4.\np\nIn the particular case of electromagnetic waves, the phase velocity is dependent on the\nmagnetic permeability as well as on the electric permittivity of the medium of propagation,\naccording to the relation:\nvp = √\n(4.3)\nμε\nThis comes from the 1-D wave equation for electromagnetic waves, which was derived in\nlecture through the recursive application of Maxwell's equations, representing the coupled be-\nhavior of varying electric fields that generate magnetic fields and vice versa. The resulting wave\nequation for the electric field is:\n∂2E\n∂2E\n= με\n(4.4)\n∂z2\n∂t2\nAnd its magnetic counterpart is:\n∂2H\n∂2H\n= με\n(4.5)\n∂z2\n∂t2\n4.2\nIndex of refraction\nWe will return to the wave equation shortly, but a digression will serve us well at this point.\nYou are probably familiar with the refractive index n of a medium. Refraction refers to the\nbending of rays of light when they pass from one medium to another, and the refractive index\ndetermines how sharp the bending will be. It is defined as the ratio between the propagation\nspeed of light in vacuum and the propagation speed of light in the medium in question:\nc\nn ≡\n(4.6)\nvp\nA medium in which light travels very slowly will have a very large index of refraction.\nWe can substitute the equation in the section above to obtain:\nc\nn =\n√1\n= c√με\n(4.7)\nμε\n\nThe speed of light in vacuum, c, is also related to the properties of the medium, and the\nproperties of this medium (vacuum) are well known:\nc = √\n(4.8)\nμ0ε0\nPutting this back into the equation for the index of refraction:\n√με\nμ\nε\nn = √\n=\n0ε0\nr\n(\n)(\n)\n(4.9)\nμ\nμ0\nε0\nThat is: the index of refraction of a medium is the square root of the product of that\nmedium's relative magnetic permeability and relative electric permittivity.\nAssuming that for the purpose of optics and wave propagation we will stay away from\nmagnetic materials (ones with high magnetic susceptibility, and hence high relative magnetic\npermeability), in most cases μ ≈μ0, and applying this approximation to our equation, we get\nsimply:\nn =\nr ε\n(4.10)\nε0\nIn a non-magnetic medium, the index of refraction is just the square root of the relative electric\npermittivity!\nAs mentioned previously at the end of section 3.3, as the permittivity depends on the fre-\nquency of the driving electric field, so will the refractive index.\n4.3\nComplex refractive index\nTo describe materials that absorb light, we must introduce a complex index of refraction, n .\nThe real index of refraction will be the real part of this complex quantity:\nne = nr -jni\n(4.11)\nnr = Re{n} = n\n(4.12)\nFor reasons that will become clear (see section\ne\n4.5), let us make a small modification, re-\nnaming the imaginary part as:\nni ≡κ\n(4.13)\nκ is called the extinction coefficient of the medium for a particular wavelength of light.\nTaking the square of the complex refractive index (to eliminate the square root on the right-\nhand side):\n(ne)2 = (n -jκ)2 = n2 + -2jκn + (jκ)2 = (n2 -κ2) -j2κn\n(4.14)\nThis whole thing must be equal to our relative complex permittivity.\nBringing back our definition from section 3.5:\nε = εr\nε0\n-jεi\n(4.15)\nThen, equating the real and imaginary\ne\nparts, we get:\nεr = n2 -κ2\n(4.16)\n\nεi = 2κn = 2nrni\n(4.17)\nFrom which we can also derive (assuming non-magnetic materials):\nn = √\nr\nεr +\nq\nε2r + ε2\ni\n(4.18)\nκ = √\nr\n-εr +\nq\nε2r + ε2\ni\n(4.19)\n4.4\nSolving the Wave Equation\nNow we will combine the concepts of complex permittivity, the Lorentz oscillator model, and\nthe wave equation to describe how electromagnetic fields propagate inside materials.\nAs shown in section 4.1, there are infinitely many functions that solve the wave equation, as\nlong as the arguments obey a certain form. Since we cannot solve all of them in a simple and\nstraightforward manner, we will focus on sinusoidal solutions.\nAs you know, the electromagnetic wave always has both an electric and a magnetic field\ncomponent. However, let us for a second consider only its electric part.\nAssume, without loss of generality, that this electric field is traveling along the +z direction,\nvarying along the y axis.\nThat is, we have Ey(z, t), which must also be a solution to the wave equation (think linear\nsuperposition).\nThe simplest guess for the form of such a wave would be:\nEy(z, t) = A cos(t -z\nv )\np\n(Notice that we did not assume the phase velocity to be c, since in general the wave could\nbe propagating in a material other than air, which we generally regard as vacuum.)\nHowever, there is a problem with the suggested form: physical units.\nDimensional analysis of the argument prevents this from being valid, since the argument to\na cosine must have units of radians or degrees, but this argument has units of time!\nHow do we fix it? We use the fact that the argument of a solution to the wave equation can\nbe multiplied by a constant so as to have the units combine properly and still be a solution.\nrad\nWhat entity would have the unit of\n? Angular frequency!\ns\nMultiplying the argument by the angular frequency of the wave, a valid form for our solution\nwould now be:\nω\nEy(z, t) = A cos(ωt -\nz)\n(4.20)\nvp\nThe next equation, called the dispersion relation, introduces another term: the angular\nwave-number. The angular wave-number is also known as the wave-vector when the wave-\nnumbers from multiple directions are combined in vector form. The wave vector is a vector\nwhose direction is the same as the propagation direction of the wave, with magnitude equal to\nthe total angular wave-number.\nω\nk =\n(4.21)\nvp\nk = ω√με\n(4.22)\nIts units are radian\nm\n(if the velocity is given in m\ns ). In vacuum, when the velocity is c, it gets\nspecial treatment, and it is referred to as β instead of k.\n\nω\nβ =\n(4.23)\nc\nSince the speed of light in a medium is related to the speed in vacuum by the index of the\nrefraction, we can derive the following relation:\nn =\nc\nvp\nc\nvp =\n(4.24)\nn\nω\nω\nωn\nk =\n=\nv\nc =\n= nβ\n(4.25)\np\nc\nn\nMoreover, we can derive another expression using the traveling wave relationship:\nvp = λf\n(4.26)\nω\n2πf\n2π\nk =\n=\n=\n(4.27)\nvp\nλf\nλ\nWriting the general solution for our electric wave, using the wave-number:\nEy(z, t) = A1 cos(ωt -kz) + A2cos(ωt + kz)\n(4.28)\nOr in vacuum (where k = nβ still holds, but n = 1):\nEy(z, t) = A1 cos(ωt -βz) + A2cos(ωt + βz)\n(4.29)\nWe can also use our now familiar phasor notation:\nE (z, t) = Re{A ej(ωt\nkz)\nj(ωt+kz)\ny\n-\n} + Re{A2e\n}\n(4.30)\nNote that, from the beginning, we have been assuming that the electric field has only a\nsingle angular frequency. These EM waves are therefore called monochromatic. In the case\nof a polychromatic wave (i.e., a pulse or wavepacket), we could split the wavepacket into\nmultiple monochromatic components and then carry out the analysis for each of the individual\nfrequencies (thanks to linear superposition and Fourier analysis!\n4.5\nBeer's law and the absorption coefficient\nSo far, these wave solutions deal only with loss-less materials (that is, (ideal) materials through\nwhich an electromagnetic wave passes without dissipation of its energy). This is often not the\ncase, and thus our model should account for lossy media as well. As you recall, our Lorentz\noscillator model already accounted for losses via the damping factor γ, which was responsible\nfor the electric permittivity becoming a complex quantity in section 3.3.\nBefore we expand on the concepts derived from the Lorentz oscillator model, let us conduct\nan intuitive analysis of a dissipating medium.\nAbsorption of light in a medium is usually defined as the fraction of the power dissipated\nper unit length of the medium. If a beam is propagating in the +z direction and the intensity\n(optical power per unit area) at position z is I(z), then the decrease of the intensity across an\nincremental slice of thickness dz is given by:\ndI = (-α)dz × I(z)\n(4.31)\n\nBy integrating this, we obtain Beer's law, also known as the Beer-Lambert law, namely:\nI(z) = I(0)e-αz\n(4.32)\nThe coefficient α is called the absorption coefficient or absorption constant, which we\nwill now analyze in more detail. It is dependent on the wavelength of light, causing some wave-\nlengths to be absorbed in a medium, while the same medium is transparent to other wavelengths.\nThe absorption coefficient has units of m-1 or cm-1.\nLet us revisit our results from section 4.3. We introduced a complex refractive index of the\nform:\nn = n -jκ\n(4.33)\nWe can generalize the wave-vector in the previous section, making it complex, and substi-\ntuting that in our plane wave solutions:\ne\nω\nk = nβ = n\n(4.34)\nc\ne\nω\nnω\nκω\nk = (n -jκ)\ne\n=\ne\ne\nk\nc\n-j\n=\njκβ\n(4.35)\nc\nc\n-\nE (z, t) = Re{A ej(ωt-ekz)} + Re{A ej(ωt+kz)\ny\n}\n(4.36)\nE (z, t) = Re{A ej[ωt-(k-jκβ)z]} + Re{A ej[ωt+(\ne\nk\ny\n-jκβ)z]}\nEy(z, t) = Re{A1ej(ωt-kz+jκβz)} + Re{A2ej(ωt+kz-jκβz)}\n(noting that j2 = -1)\nE (z, t) = Re{A e[j(ωt-kz)\ny\n-κβz]} + Re{A2e[j(ωt+k)+κβz]}\nEy(z, t) = Re{A e-κβzej(ωt-kz)} + Re{A eκβzej(ωt+kz)\n}\n(4.37)\nObserving that the exponential factor containing κ is purely real, let us evaluate the real\npart of the expression above:\nEy(z, t) = A1e-κβz cos(ωt -kz) + A2eκβz cos(ωt + kz)\n(4.38)\nIf the wave is traveling in the +z direction, corresponding to the first term, z is increasing,\nand the exponential factor's exponent is decreasing, \"becoming more negative\". If it is traveling\nin the -z direction, z is decreasing, and the exponent of the second term is also becoming\nmore negative. In either case, the magnitude of the exponential is decreasing, and therefore the\nelectric field is being attenuated.\n\nIntensity is proportional to the square of the magnitude of the electric field. Taking the\nfirst term only, for the sake of simplicity, we can say that if the electric field is decreasing\nwith e-κβz, then the intensity of this wave is decreasing proportionally to (e-κβz)2 = e-2κβz.\nComparing this to Beer's law, we obtain the relationship between the absorption coefficient α\nand the extinction coefficient κ:\n2κω\n4πκ\nα = 2κβ =\n=\n(4.39)\nc\nλ\nA medium in which α is negative is called a gain medium, as the electric field increases by\nacquiring energy previously stored in the medium. Lasers are produced by stimulated emission\nin a gain medium. When α(ω) is very small (close to 0), the medium is transparent for that\nfrequency.\n4.6\nAnother quick review of terms\n- λ is the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave\n- τ is the period of the wave, the inverse of its frequency f\n- ω is the angular frequency of the wave, and it is equal to 2πf = 2π\nτ\n- β is the wave-vector in vacuum, with magnitude ω\nc\n- ek is the wave-vector in materials, equal to nβ\n- k is the real part of k, and it is equal to\nω\nvp\ne\n= 2π\nλ = nβ\n- α is the absorption co\ne\nefficient of the medium for some wavelength\n- κ is the extinction coefficient of the medium for some wavelength, and it is the imaginary\npart of n\nOptica\ne\nl properties of materials\n5.1\nOther EM-Wave Phenomena\nUp to now, we have specifically investigated refraction and absorption. These two processes are\na subset of phenomena that EM waves exhibit. In the most general division, there are three\nphenomena: propagation, reflection and transmission.\n\nPropagation is simply the movement of a wave through a medium. When a wave hits a\nboundary, that is, an interface between two media of different refractive indices, the wave can\neither bounce back (reflection) or pass through the boundary (transmission), either completely\nor partially.\nRefraction happens to a transmitted wave, its change in direction (bending) being due to\na change in phase velocity.\nWhen the wave is propagating through a medium, absorption occurs if the frequency of\nthe wave's photons (particles of electromagnetic radiation) is near the resonant frequency of\nsome type of excitation in the material. Once a photon has been absorbed, the energy can be\ndissipated through heating the medium or reemitted in either spontaneous emission (e.g.,\nwhat occurs in a light-emitting diode, LED) or stimulated emission (e.g., what occurs in a\nLASER).\nScattering is the name given to the phenomenon in which the medium causes part of the\npropagating radiation to change direction. In general, scattering is one of the factors responsible\nfor the damping represented in the Lorentz oscillator model, but for simplicity we assume here\nthat all attenuation is due to absorption.\nA number of other phenomena can also occur to a propagated wave, but these generally\nbelong to the field of nonlinear optics.\n5.2\nOptical coefficients\n5.2.1\nReflection and transmission coefficients in loss-less media\nH\nincident wave\nreflected wave\ntransmitted wave\nMedium 1\nMedium 2\nz^\nIn the picture above, assume that both media are dielectrics (i.e., poor conductors-the\nimportance of this assumption will be seen when we discuss the Drude model).\nWe have n1 and n2 as the indices of refraction of mediums 1 and 2, respectively.\nThe\ncorresponding wave-vectors are k1 = n1β and k2 = n2β. As you recall, β = ω\nc . Therefore, in\norder for us to accept that the waves have identical β in both mediums 1 and 2, their angular\nfrequencies must be identical. The frequency of an electromagnetic wave does not change when\npassing from a medium to another. The wavelength changes, due to the different phase velocity\n(think vp = λf), but the frequency is kept unaltered unless in the case of scattering or other\nnonlinear phenomena that require quantum physics for an explanation. In short: the frequency\n\ndefines the photons carrying that wave, their energy being given by the equation that Planck\nexperimentally derived, ε = hf, where h is Planck's constant. Therefore, for the frequency\nto change, the photons would have to become different photons! Photons are self-contained and\nindependent of other photons, as you will see later in the course, so it is not trivial for a change\nin frequency to occur.\nWe will treat only the case of normal incidence (perpendicular to the boundary plane, as\nopposed to oblique incidence, when waves hit the plane at an angle). The general scenario\nwill be analyzed in class through the derivation of Fresnel's equations.\nAssume that the electric field is confined to the xz-plane, meaning the electric field vector\nalways has its direction only along the x-axis, as indicated by the subscript (which implies\nthat this wave must be linearly polarized along the x direction). Let us call Ei\nx(z, t) the\nmagnitude of the incident electric field, Er\nx(z, t) for the reflected electric field and Et\nx(z, t) for\nthe transmitted electric field. We can write equations for these waves:\n-\nE\n→i\nx(z, t) = xE\nˆ\ni\n0ej(ωt-k1z): traveling in the +z direction, within medium 1\n-E→r\nr j(ωt+k1z)\nx(z, t) = xE\nˆ\n0e\n: traveling in the -z direction, within medium 1\n-E→t(z, t) = xE\nˆ\ntej(ωt\nk\nx\n-\n2z): traveling in the +z direction, within medium 2\nDropping the ejωtterms for our phasor notation (the t in the left-hand side of the equation\nwas kept to indicate that we are using phasor notation):\n-\nE\n→i\nx(z, t) = xE\nˆ\ni\n0e-jk1z\n(5.1)\n-E→r\nx(z, t) = xE\nˆ\nr\n0e+jk1z\n(5.2)\n-\nE\n→t(z, t) = xE\nˆ\nt\nz\nx\ne\n-jk\n(5.3)\nNote that these are vectors, all along the direction of the x-axis. We now impose a boundary\ncondition of continuity, derived from Maxwell's equations applied to the interface considering\nthe parallel (tangential) and perpendicular (orthogonal) portions of the electric and magnetic\nfields: at z = 0, where the three of them (incident, reflected and transmitted fields) meet, the\ntangential electric field is always continuous, and the perpendicular electric field is continuous\nif there is no surface charge at the boundary. In our case, with no surface charge, whatever is\non the left side of the interface (at z = 0-) must be equal to whatever is on the right side (at\nz = 0+). Thus, for any time t:\n-\nE\n→i\nx(0, t) + -E→r\nt\nx(0, t) =\n-\nE\n→\nx(0, t)\n(5.4)\nThe left-hand side of this equation shows the superposition of the incident and reflected\nwaves. The exponentials all take the value of 1 for z = 0. Eliminating the vectors (again, for\nany time t):\nEi\nr\nt\n0 + E0 = E0\n(5.5)\nNow, assume we know the value of the incident wave (for example, because we sent it from\nsome transmitter), but we do not know what will go through the interface and what will bounce\nback. Divide the whole equation by Ei\n0:\nEi\nEr\nt\n+\nE\n=\nEi\nEi\nEi\n(5.6)\nWe define the reflection coefficient r as:\n\nEr\nr ≡\nEi\n(5.7)\nAnd the transmission coefficient t as:\nEt\nt ≡\nEi\n(5.8)\nTherefore, we can rewrite our equation as:\n1 + r = t\n(5.9)\nThis relation is always valid, even for oblique incidence or lossy media, as it is mentioned in\nsection 5.2.4.\nFor loss-less media, r and t are real numbers. Note that the reflected electric field cannot be\nlarger in magnitude than the incident electric field, but they can have equal magnitudes (in the\ncase of total reflection), and can also have opposite signs. Hence:\n-1 ≤r ≤1\n(5.10)\nTogether with the equation above, this gives us:\n0 ≤t ≤2\n(5.11)\n5.2.2\nIntrinsic impedance\nAt some point in the derivation of the 1-D Wave Equation for electromagnetic waves, the cor-\nrected Amp`ere's circuital law was used, namely:\nI\n-→\nH -→\ndl =\nZ -→\nd\nJ -dA\n→+\nC\nS\ndt\nZ\nε-→\nE -dA\n→\n(5.12)\nS\nFrom this law, assuming a medium with no free current-sources, that is, with -→\nJ = 0, it was\nconcluded that, at any time t, for some point z0 (the square brackets indicate we are evaluating\nthe result of the derivative at point z = z0):\n∂By(z, t)\n∂\n=\n∂z\n\nμε\nz0\nEx(z, t)\n∂t\n\n(5.13)\nz0\nTherefore, since the magnetic flux density -→\nB and the magnetic field -→\nH are related by:\n-→\nB = μ-→\nH\n(5.14)\nWe can reduce that equation to:\n∂Hy(z, t)\n∂z\n\n= ε\nz0\n∂Ex(z, t)\n∂t\n\n(5.15)\nz0\nIf we have an electromagnetic wave traveling in the +z direction, whose electric component\nis given (in phasor notation) by:\n-E→\nx(z, t) = xE\nˆ\nj(ωt\nkz)\n0e\n-\n(5.16)\nThen, following the right-hand rule, its magnetic portion must be given by:\n-H→\ny(z, t) = yˆH0ej(ωt-kz)\n(5.17)\n\nNow, applying the reduced equation derived from Amp`ere's circuital law:\n∂Hy(z, t)\n∂Ex(z, t)\n= ε\n(\n∂z\nz0\n\n18)\n∂\n\n5.\nt\nz0\nH0j(-k)ej(ωt-kz0) = εE0jωej(ωt-kz0)\n(5.19)\nCanceling the exponentials and the j's, and taking only the absolute values (ignoring the\ndirection for the moment):\nkH0 = εωE0\n(5.20)\nBut k = ω\nv , so:\np\nω H0 = εωE0\n(5.21)\nvp\nCanceling ω's and writing v = √1\np\nμε, we get:\nε\nH0 = √\nE0\n(5.22)\nμε\nWhich is the same as:\nH0 =\nr ε E0\n(5.23)\nμ\nThe quantity η = |E|\nH is called the electromagnetic wave impedance, intrinsic impedance\n|\n|\nor characteristic impedance, namely:\nμ\nη =\nr\n(5.24)\nε\nLike the velocity of propagation for EM waves and the index of refraction, the impedance\nV\ndepends exclusively on the properties of the medium. Since the elehctriic field has units of [\n] and\nm\nA\nthe magnetic field has units of [\n], the impedance has units of\nV\nm\nA\n= [ V\nA] = [Ω] (resistance!),\nm\nand in vacuum its value is:\nm\nrμ\n=\nη0\nε0\n∼= 377Ω\n(5.25)\nFrom the intrinsic impedance, we can always determine the electric field of an EM wave if we\nknow the magnetic field, and vice versa. Note, however, that this relates the amplitude of the\nelectric and magnetic fields at a point, but we still have to account for the direction of the fields:\nour equation derived from Amp`ere's law had some time and spatial derivatives in it, which will\nbring down j's and negative signs.\nThere is also a straightforward relationship between the impedance and the index of refraction\nof a medium:\nμ\n=\nrμ\nc\nη\n=\nε\n√\n= μvp = μ\n(5.26)\nμε\nn\nWhich can also be written as:\n( μ )η\n=\nμ\nη\n(5.27)\nn\n\nThus, for non-magnetic media (μ ∼= μ0), the intrinsic impedance of the medium is simply:\nη\n=\nη\n(5.28)\nn\n5.2.3\nReflection and transmission coefficients revisited\nLet us now repeat what we did in section 5.2.1, now for the corresponding magnetic wave. We\nhave the incident, reflected and transmitted magnetic waves (\n-\nH\n→i\ny, -H→r\nyand -H→t\ny, respectively), in\nthe yz-plane (linearly polarized along the y direction:\n-\nH\n→i(z, t) = yˆHiej(ωt-k1z)\ny\n: traveling in the +z direction, within medium 1\n-H→r\ny(z, t) = yˆHr\n0ej(ωt+k1z): traveling in the -z direction, within medium 1\n-H→t(z, t) = yˆHtej(ωt-k2z)\ny\n: traveling in the +z direction, within medium 2\nApplying to each of these (and their respective electric field counterparts) the equation\nderived from Amp`ere's law:\nh\n∂Hy(z,t)\n∂z\ni\n= ε\nx\nz\nh\n∂E (z,t)\n∂t\ni\nz0\nHij(-k )ej(ωt-k1z0) = εEijωej(ωt\n-k1z )\n(5.29)\nHrjk ej(ωt+k1z0)\n= εEr\n0jωej(ωt+k1z0)\n(5.30)\nHt\n0j(-k2)ej(ωt-k2z0) = εEt\n0jωej(ωt-k2z0)\n(5.31)\nAgain, canceling all the j's and exponentials:\nHi\n0(-k1) = εωEi\n(5.32)\nHr\n0k\nr\n1 = εωE0\n(5.33)\nHt\n0(-k2) = εωEt\n(5.34)\nAnd using our definition for impedance:\nk\n√με\nrμ\n=\n=\n=\n= η\n(5.35)\nεω\nεvp\nε\nε\nWe conclude:\nHi\nEi\n0 = -\n(5.36)\nη1\nHr\nEr\n0 =\n(5.37)\nη1\nt\nHt\nE\n= -\n(5.38)\nη2\nWe observe the following pattern (where the + and -subscripts refer to propagation in the\n+z or -z direction, respectively):\n\nηHy+ + ηHy\n= -Ex+ + Ex\n(5.39)\n-\n-\nRecall our equation:\n-\nE\n→i\nx(0, t) + -E→r\nx(0, t) = -E→t\nx(0, t)\nor\nEi\n0 + Er\n0 = Et\nThis equation was obtained by imposition of continuity at the boundary (at z = 0). Analo-\ngously, we can do the same for the magnetic field:\n-\nH\n→i\ny(0, t) + -H→r\ny(0, t) =\n-\nH\n→t\ny(0, t)\n(5.40)\nHi\n0 + Hr\nt\n0 = H0\n(5.41)\nSubstituting the relations we just derived between the magnetic and electric fields:\nEi\nr\nt\n-\nE\n+\nE\n=\nη1\nη1\n-\n(5.42)\nη2\nRearranging:\nη2Ei\n0 -η2Er\n0 = η1Et\n(5.43)\nAnd using our previous continuity equation:\nEi\n0 + Er\n0 = Et\nWe get:\nη2Ei\n0 -η2Er\n0 = η1(Ei\n0 + Er\n0)\nDivide both sides by Ei\n0 and apply the definition for the reflection coefficient r (in this case,\nr12, specifying that the wave is coming from medium 1 into medium 2):\nη2 -\nEr\nη\ni = η1(1 + Er\nE0\nEi )\nη2 -η2r12 = η1 + η1r12\nFrom which we get:\nη\nr12 =\n2 -η1\n(5.44)\nη2 + η1\nUsing 1 + r = t:\n2η2\nt12 =\n(5.45)\nη2 + η1\nThis being the transmission coefficient from medium 1 into medium 2.\nFor yet another form for the coefficients, apply the substitution η = η0\nn (which can only be\ndone assuming μ1 = μ2 ∼= μ0) :\n\nη0\n= n2\nn\n-η0\nn\nη\nn\n-\nn\nn1\nn\nr\n1n2\nη0 + η0 =\n-\nη\nn1+n2\n=\n\n!\n(5.46)\nn1\nn\nn\n+\nn1\nn1n2\n2η0\nt\n=\nn2\nη\n=\n2n\nη0 + η0\nη\n\nn\nn1+n2\nn2\nn n2\n!\n=\n(5.47)\nn1\nn\n+ n2\nSince η1\nη = n2\nn , to switch between the impedance form and the refractive index form, simply\nexchange\nη1 ⇔n2 and η2 ⇔n1.\nFrom the formula for the reflection coefficient, one thing can be noted: if n1 > n2, if the wave\nis traveling from a more refractive medium to a less refractive one (called a soft boundary),\nr > 0, and a positive r means that the Ei\nr\n0 and E0 have the same direction; therefore, no inversion\nof the field occurs. Conversely, when n1 < n2 (a hard boundary), r < 0 and the directions of\nthe incident and reflected electric fields are opposite; put another way, the directions are 180o\nout of phase.\nThat is, the electric field flips when the wave hits a hard boundary, and only in that case.\nThe transmitted electric field, however, always has the same direction as the incident electric\nfield; they are always in phase.\n5.2.4\nComplex reflection and transmission coefficients\nFollowing the trend, we generalize so as to include lossy media as well by making these coefficients\ncomplex.\nThe nice thing is that it is quite trivial: all n's become ne's, all η's become ηe's and we got\nout re and et.\nIn order to show it, we would just repeat the derivation using k's as our wave-vectors.\nThe full expression for r\ne\ne is:\ne\nne1 -ne2\n(ne1r -ne2r) -j(n1\nr\n=\n=\ne\ni -ne2i)\n(n1\n(κ1\n-\n2)\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\n=\n-n2) -j\nκ\ne\n(5.48)\nn1 + n2\n(n1r + n2r) -j(n1i + n2i)\n(n1 + n2) -j(κ1 + κ2)\nSimilarly, for et:\ne\n2n1\n2n1r -j2n1\n2n1\nj2κ1\nt\ni\n12 =\n=\n=\n-\n(5.49)\nn1 + n2\n(n1r + n2r) -j(n1i + n2i)\n(n1 + n2) -j(κ1 + κ2)\nAgain, the magni\nfle\ne\ne\ntu\ne\nde\ne\nof the\ne\nre\ne\ncted elect\ne\ne\nric fiel\ne\nd cannot be larger than the incident one.\nHowever, since we are now dealing with complex numbers:\n|re| ≤1\n(5.50)\n|t| ≤2\n(5.51)\n5.3\nReflectivity and Transmittance\ne\nThe concepts of reflectivity and transmittance are not very distant from coefficients analyzed\nin the previous section. The only difference is they are determined in terms of the power (or,\nequivalently, in terms of the intensity) of the wave that gets reflected or transmitted, respectively.\nThe intensity ( power\narea , or power density) of an electromagnetic wave is given by the magnitude\nof the Poynting vector -→\nS (the notation -→\nS was chosen by John Henry Poynting himself\nwhen the concept was introduced in his original 1884 paper proving the now called Poynting's\ntheorem):\n\n-→\n-→\nP\nS =\n= -→\nE\n-→\n× H\n(5.52)\nA\nThe Poynting vector points in the direction of power transfer (which happens to be the\ndirection of propagation of the wave).\nThis being a cross-product, we can simplify the equation for orthogonal electric and magnetic\nfields and can therefore say its magnitude is:\nIntensity(t)= -→\nS (t) = →\n-\n-\n|\n|\n|E (t) →\nπ\n||H(t)| sin(\n) = -→\nE (t) →\n-\n|\n||H(t)|\n(5.53)\nWe recently showed that the magnitude of the magnetic field at any point is related to the\nmagnitude of the electric field by the impedance:\n→\n-\n-→\n|E -→\nE 2\n||H| = |\n|\n= η →\n-\nη\n|H|2\n(5.54)\nGenerally, the intensity is taken as the time-average of the Poynting vector since both -→\nE\nand -→\nH vary with time.\nI =< -→\n1 -→\nE (t ) 2\n| S (\n|\nt)| >=\n|\n(5.55)\nη\nThe factor of 1\n2 comes from averaging the squared sinusoidal part over a period (the angle <\n> brackets denote time-average; a sinusoidal, instead of its square, has 0 average over a period).\nFor this choice of definition for intensity, the electric field can be taken at any time-point for\ncalculations.\nTherefore, if we would like to calculate the reflectance, that is, the portion of the incident\npower that was reflected:\n-→\nr 2\nreflected power density\n1 |E |\nE-→r\nη\nR =\n= 2\n=\n= r 2\n(5.56)\nincident power density\n1 E\n-→i|2\n-\nE\n→i\nη\n\n|\n|\n\n|\nUsing our complex reflection coefficient from section 5.2.\n\n4, al\n\nong with the fact that the\nmagnitude of the ratio of two complex numbers is the ratio of their magnitudes:\n(n\n=\n1 -n2)2 + (κ1 -κ2)\nR\n(5.57)\n(n1 + n\n2) + (κ1 + κ\n2)\nA typical reflectivity curve for insulating materials is plotted in section 5.4.2.\nIn a loss-less medium, all power from the incident wave must be either reflected or transmit-\nted. Therefore, applying conservation of energy:\nreflected power + transmitted power = incident power\nreflected power + transmitted power\nincident power\nincident power\n= 1\nR + T = 1\n(5.58)\nWhere T stands for the transmittance, the portion of the power that passes through the\nboundary.\nFrom this, using our previous formula for reflectivity, we obtain:\n4n\nT =\n1n2 + 4κ1κ2\n(5.59)\n(n1 + n2)2 + (κ1 + κ2)2\nNote that T = |t |2!!! (Can you figure out why? See question 5)\n\n5.4\nT-A-R-T\nOur final section deals with the most practical aspect of all the theory discussed. Materials will\nbe split in three groups for analysis: insulators (dielectrics), free-electron metals and plasmas.\n5.4.1\nA more intuitive frequency analysis\nIn section 3.5, we explained how the magnitude and phase of the displacement (of the electron, in\nour Lorentz oscillator model) varied with the frequency of the driving electric field. We did not\nhave the tools yet to explain the response of the material to EM waves of different frequencies,\napart from the effect on the displacement of the electron. That analysis will be carried out in\nthis section.\nAs mentioned in section 5.1, absorption takes place when the frequency (or frequencies) of an\nEM wave matches one (or more) of the resonant frequencies of the material, what we called ω0\nin the derivation of the Lorentz oscillator model. In fact, resonance is exactly this phenomenon\nof frequency-matching when driving any kind of oscillator. Therefore, when the frequency of\nthe electromagnetic wave is in the vicinity of ω0, the predominant behavior in the material is\nabsorption. What about before or after that frequency?\n5.4.2\nInsulators\nThe optical response is quite typical for a wide range of dielectric materials. The plots above\nrepresent such typical behavior.\nFrom the plot on the left, we can see there is a peak in εi around ω = ω0 (the resonance\nfrequency for the material), and this peak levels offquickly for both lower or higher frequencies.\nThe peak corresponds to the strong absorption of the electromagnetic radiation by the material\nnear that frequency.\nWe also notice that, as we increase frequency, both εr and n increase before ω0, reach a\nminimum then start rising again. Normal dispersion is the name given to the phenomenon\nof rising permittivity and refractive index with frequency, while anomalous dispersion is the\ndecrease in permittivity and index of refraction that takes place around the resonance frequency.\nThe region of anomalous dispersion can be determined by setting to 0 the derivative of\nε\nε0\nwith respect to frequency (i.e., by finding the frequencies for which deε\ndω = 0, which correspond to\ne\n\nthe points of maximum and minimum). These points are found to be ω = ω0+ γ\n2 and ω = ω0-γ\n2 ,\ncomprising a region of width equal to the damping constant, γ.\nThe frequency-dependent optical behavior of a material is divided in regions: T for trans-\nmission (or \"transparency\"), A for absorption and R for reflection. The absorption behavior has\nbeen explained, but we are left to understand the reflection region. The following reflectivity\ncurve corresponds to the same insulator whose optical behavior is shown in the previous plots:\nRemember that absorption only takes place around the resonant frequency. Thus, energy is\nconserved in the other regions: so they are either predominantly transmissive, or predominantly\nreflective. As it was stated above, the region of anomalous dispersion has a width of value γ.\nSome authors choose to define the anomalous dispersion region as the absorption region, but in\norder to cover a larger portion of the absorption curve, we define it in this plot as centered at\nω0, but with width equal to double the anomalous dispersion's, namely 2γ.\nFrom the plot above, we can see that reflectivity starts increasing in the absorption region.\nAlthough there may indeed be appreciable reflectivity (of the portion of light that is not ab-\nsorbed) in this region, the reflectivity only becomes proportionally significant for frequencies in\nthe region labeled R. Referring to the previous plots, we notice that in that region n < κ, which,\nas shown by our equation, yields εr < 0 - which is always true within the reflective region, but\nthe converse is not true: not all frequencies for which εr < 0 will be predominantly reflected,\nas they could also belong to the absorption region. Alluding to Feynman's statement in section\n3.2, the reflection region has its outer boundary defined at ω = ωp. In the plot, the boundary\nwas taken at the point where εr crosses the x-axis (εr(ω) = 0 for ω > ω0). One can verify that\nthese two statements are equivalent if we consider that ω ≫ω0 ≫γ in the formula for εr.\nThe last region is another transmission region: the insulator is completely transparent at\nvery high frequencies.\nTo summarize the regions for a dielectric material:\n- Transmissive for 0 < ω < ω0 -γ\n- Absorptive for ω0 -γ < ω < ω0 + γ\n- Reflective for ω0 + γ < ω < ωp\n- Transmissive for ω > ωp\nGr\nap\nh\nof\nr\nef\nle\nct\niv\nit\ny\nvs\n.\nw\na\nvelen\ngt\nh\n.\nImage by MIT OpenCourseWare.\n\n5.4.3\nMetals: the Drude-Lorentz model\nIn 1900, Paul Drude proposed the Drude model for electrical conduction, the result of\napplying kinetic theory to electrons in a solid. In metals, the electrons are not bound to the\nnuclei - the potential energy distribution of a metallic lattice makes it as energetically favorable\nfor electrons to jump around from side to side - from one nucleus to another - as staying bound to\na single nucleus. These delocalized electrons constitute which is known as the \"sea of electrons\"\nthat flows freely around the lattice of nuclei, and are the one thing that allows metals to conduct\nelectricity.\nConsider a particular change in our Lorentz oscillator model: in this metallic bond, if the\nelectrons are not bound, then there is no analogous of a restoring \"spring\" force.\nThat is,\nFspring = 0, hence the equivalent spring constant associated with it is equal to 0.\nGoing back to one of our first equations, k = mω2\n0, we see that this condition yields ω0=0.\nNevertheless, there is still a damping term, due mostly to the collisions within the electron\ncloud and with the nuclei.\nOur model then becomes:\neε\nω2\n= 1\n60)\nε0\n-\np\n(5.\nω2 -jωγ\n(Note that the negative signs agree with the ones in the original equation.)\nThis is the so-called Drude-Lorentz model for metals.\nAlthough updated models exist for metals, which take advantage of quantum theory and\nBoltzmann statistics, the Drude model is very useful to develop accurate intuitions regarding\nthe optical behavior of metals.\nMetals do not exhibit the first T region; they start at the absorption region for low fre-\nquencies. That absorption region, however, is quite limited, ending at ω = γ, which is usually\np\n\nT\nR\n\na relatively small number compared to the other parameters. After that, metals exhibit re-\ngions like the insulator, a reflective region and a transparent region (in fact, the electrons of\nthe insulator are the ones that behave like a metal's free electrons for frequencies in those two\nregions).\nNote the different y-axis scales on the left plot: the magnitude of εr is much greater than εi.\nAt the plasma frequency, we observe that n = 0. But what does that mean? Given the definition\nof the real index of refraction, it means that the velocity in the medium approaches inf, as well\nas infinite wavelength for the wave. An infinite wavelength means that all the electron dipoles\nin the material are oscillating in phase, but this does not suit as a good intuition. In order to\nunderstand this, one would have to compare the Drude-Lorentz model to the behavior of real\nmetals, but that shall not be covered here. Let us continue with the practical insights that we\ncan indeed obtain from these results. Namely, the reflectivity curve of a metal is:\nThe rainbow-colored strip is included to indicate where the visible light range belongs in\nsuch a curve, calculated for a typical metal.\nSummarizing these results, we have the following optical regions in a metal:\n- Absorptive, for 0 < ω < γ\n- Reflective, for γ < ω < ωp\n- Transmissive, for ω > ωp\n5.4.4\nPlasmas\nIn the case of a plasma, our model gets simplified even further. As in the case of metals, there\nis no restoring force, so ω0 = 0 here as well. In a plasma, however, the electrons in the \"cloud\"\nare far enough from each other and from the ionized nuclei that they do not collide, statistically\nspeaking (i.e., the plasma has a very small value of mean free collision time). Then, the only\nloss of energy would be due to re-radiation, but then that re-radiation would be absorbed by\nsome other dipole and re-re-radiated, \"ad infinitum\". For this reason, the damping term γ is\nnull as well.\nThe simplified permittivity equation for plasmas is then just:\nReflection(%)\nT\nR\np\n\nω\n=\nε\neε\n-\np\n(5.61)\nω2\nThis result does not depart much from the results obtained for metals. If you recall, when the\nT-A-R-T regions for a metal (in fact, only A-R-T), it was stated that although metals do exhibit\nan absorptive region, it is very narrow, extending only up to the value of the damping factor γ,\nwhich was also assumed to be very small (and, in the real world, it is indeed). Therefore, as we\nmake γ = 0 here, we get exactly the same response, except that for a plasma there is not even\nan absorption region-we are left with only R-T.\n- Reflective, for 0 < ω < ωp\n- Transmissive, for ω > ωp\nWhen the plasma frequency was introduced and Richard Feynman was quoted regarding its\nsignificance for the behavior of signal transmission, it was exactly this behavior that was being\ndescribed: plasmas (and metals to some extent) are entirely reflective for electromagnetic waves\nof frequency less than the medium's plasma frequency, and entirely transmissive for frequencies\nabove it.\nThis completes the introduction to the Lorentz oscillator and the applications derived from\nit. The next section includes some problems for practice.\nQuestions\n1.

Calculate\nthe thickness of the crystal if it behaves as a quarter-wave plate for 500nm light.\n5. In section 5.3, we derived the equation for the transmittance T in a loss-less medium from\nconservation of energy, subtracting the reflectivity from unity. Actually, this calculation\nis done by using Stokes' method of time-reversal of light rays: considering the scenario in\nwhich the transmitted ray is going in the reverse direction (hence, being the new \"incident\nray\"), then adding the respective components of its refracted and reflected rays, and mak-\ning everything equal to what was was there in the original \"before time-reversal\" scenario.\nRe-derive the formula for transmittance in a loss-less medium,\n(a) using the Poynting vector, by writing the electric and magnetic components at each\npoint (Hint: the transmitted wave lies in a different medium, with different properties\nfrom the incident medium).\n(b) by using Stokes' time-reversal principal.

(iii) Show that tt′ -rr′ = 1.\n6. Take an insulator whose resonance frequency is ω0 = 5.4 × 1014 rad\ns , damping factor\nγ = 0.18ω0, plasma frequency ω = 6.8 × 1016 rad\np\ns .\n(a) What is the electron density of this material?\nFor the following, use MATLAB or your favorite plotting program.

Germanium - named after his homeland by Clemens Winkler, the first person to isolate\nthe element, in 1886 - is an important semiconductor material used in transistors and\nvarious other electronic devices. For example, germanium is the substrate of the wafers\nfor high-efficiency multijunction photovoltaic cells for space applications. Germanium-on-\ninsulator substrates are seen as a potential replacement for silicon on miniaturized chips,\nand its compound CdGeAs2 (cadmium-germanium-arsenide) is considered a very promis-\ning material in the field of optoelectronics. The complex refractive index of germanium at\n\n400nm is given by ne = 4.141 -j2.215. Calculate for germanium at 400nm, in MKS units:\na) The phase velocity of light propagating in it\nb) Its absorption coefficient\nc) Its complex electric permittivity\nd) Its impedance\ne) Its reflection and transmission coefficients for incident light propagating in air\nf) Its reflectivity (percentage) for incident light as above\n8.

Terahertz lasers (T-rays) are a hot area of research these days. Terahertz radiation, whose\nfrequencies lie in the 300GHz to 3THz range (between infrared and microwave), passes\nthrough clothing, plastic paper, wood, plastic, among other materials, but it does not\npass through water or metals. For that reason, airport security T-ray scanners are being\ndeveloped, so that a metal (gun, knife etc) would be visible to the detector even if hidden\nunder clothing or inside objects.\nThe National Security Agency, skeptical, needs more information regarding the technology.\nLearning that you are a 6.007 graduate, they hire you to determine if the concept is indeed\nfail-proof.\na) Assuming a Lorentz oscillator model with standard values for the electron mass and\ncharge, and using your knowledge of reflectivity, determine what would be the maximum\nelectron density of a material so that T-rays can pass through it.\nb) The plasma frequency of a typical metal is within the range of 1 to 4 PHz (PetaHertz,\n1015Hz, in the ultraviolet range).

Are\nphotons, electrons, atoms best described as particles or waves? Simultaneous wave-particle\ndescription might be the most accurate interpretation, which leads us to develop a mathe-\nmatical abstraction.\nRules for 1-D Quantum Mechanics\nOur mathematical abstraction of choice is the wave function, sometimes denoted as ψ, and\nit allows us to predict the statistical outcomes of experiments (i.e., the outcomes of our\nmeasurements) according to a few rules\n1. At any given time, the state of a physical system is represented by a wave function\nψ (x), which--for our purposes--is a complex, scalar function dependent on position.\nThe quantity ρ (x) = ψ∗(x) ψ (x) is a probability density function. Furthermore, ψ is\ncomplete, and tells us everything there is to know about the particle.\n2. Every measurable attribute of a physical system is represented by an operator that acts\non the wave function. In 6.007, we're largely interested in position (xˆ) and momentum\n(pˆ) which have operator representations in the x-dimension\nħ∂\nxˆ →x\npˆ →\n.\n(1)\ni ∂x\nOutcomes of measurements are described by the expectation values of the operator\nħ∂ψ\n⟨xˆ⟩=\nZ\ndxψ∗xψ\n⟨pˆ⟩=\ndxψ∗\n.\n(2)\ni ∂x\nIn general, any dynamical variable Q can be expressed\nZ\nas a function of x and p, and\nwe can find the expectation value of\n⟨Q (x, p)⟩=\nZ\ndxψ∗Q\n\nh ∂\nx,\nψ\ni ∂x\n\n.\n(3)\n3. The time evolution of the wave function is described by the Schrodinger wave equation,\na partial differential equation that is fundamentally a statement of energy conservation:\n∂ψ\npˆ2\niħ\n=\n∂t\n\n+ V (xˆ)\nψ\n2m\nħ2 ∂2ψ\n\n= -\n+ V (xˆ) ψ.\n(4)\n2m ∂x2\n\n6.007 Spring 2011\nTutorial 10: Quantum Mechanics in 1-D Potentials\nThe operator acting on ψ on the right is called the Hamiltonian.\nFixed energy\nsolutions--eigenstates--of this equation are called stationary states (because they don't\nevolve in time), and are found by solving the \"time-independent\" Schrodinger wave\nequation:\nħ2 ∂2ψ\nEψ = -\n+ V (xˆ) ψ.\n(5)\n2m ∂x2\nHeisenberg Uncertainty and Photons\nIn lecture, our characterization of measurement uncertainty dealt with the observation of\nelectrons with photons of definite energy and momentum\n2πħ\nE = ħω\np = ħk =\n.\n(6)\nλ\nThe Heisenberg microscope shows that it's difficult to simultaneously know the position and\nmomentum of observed electrons with great precision:\nħ\n∆x∆p ≥\n.\n(7)\nFrom basic probability theory, it can be shown that the uncertainty in x is given by,\n⟨(∆x)2⟩= ⟨x2⟩-⟨x⟩2 =\nZ\ndxψ∗x2ψ -(\nZ\ndxψ∗xψ )2.\n(8)\n2.1\nInfinite Square-Well\nUsing the tools of quantum mechanics we can numerically solve for energy levels of an electron\ntrapped in a potential well of any arbitrary shape. However, if instead of using numerical\nmethods and a computer, we want to calculate the solutions to the Schrodinger equation\nanalytically, we will find that very few potential shapes are exactly-analytically-solvable in\nquantum mechanics. One of the exactly-solvable problems is that of an infinitely tall square\npotential for which we can calculate energy eigenstates of an electron trapped within such\nwell. Here are the solutions you will find:\n1. Solutions to 1-D Schrodinger equation are eigenstates given by wavefinctions\nψ (x) =\nr\nnπ\nn\nsin (knx) =\nr\nsin\nL\nL\n\nx\nL\n\n(9)\nwith associated energies\nħ2k2\nEn =\nn\nn2π2ħ\n=\n.\n(10)\n2m\n2mL2\nNote that these are called energy eigenstates because they were states of definite energy,\nmeaning that ∆E = 0.\n\n6.007 Spring 2011\nTutorial 10: Quantum Mechanics in 1-D Potentials\n2. The eigenstates are alternately even and odd with respect to the center of the well.\n3. The eigenstates are mutually orthogonal, meaning that\nZ\nψm\n∗(x) ψn (x) = δmn,\n(11)\nwhere δmn is 0 if m = n, and 1 if m = n. For calculating expectation values for the\ninfinite square well where m = n, the following identity will be useful:\nsin2\n(θ) =\n[1\n-cos (2θ)] .\n(12)\nQualitative Properties of Wave Functions\nWhen we are only interested in qualitative behavior of the wave function then we can sketch\nexpected wave functions for different energy levels following some simple rules:\n1. Outside of the potential well we expect the wave function to decay smoothly to zero.\nThe larger the difference between the potential V and the particle energy E, the faster\nwe expect the wave function to decay. If the potential V at the boundary is infinite,\nthen the wave function will go to zero right at the boundary.\n2. Inside the potential well, we expect the wave function to behave roughly like a sine or\ncosine function.\n3. We expect any symmetry in the potential well to be reflected in the wave function.\nIf we identify a point of symmetry in the potential, then the wave function should be\neither an even or odd function about that point.\n4. The number of nodes in the wave function for a state should be the state number (n)\nminus 1 (n = 1 for ground state, 2 for first excited state, and so on).\n5. The curvature of the wave function is related to the kinetic energy of the state. If\nthe well has a potential that varies with position, then in regions with higher kinetic\nenergy the wave function should have a shorter \"wavelength\".\n6. If the well has a potential that varies with position, the particle will spend less time in\nregions where it has higher potential energy so the wave function will be (relatively)\nsmaller in those regions.\n\n6.007 Spring 2011\nTutorial 10: Quantum Mechanics in 1-D Potentials\nExample 1: Mystery Wave Function\nConsider the wave function\nψ (x, t) = Ae-λ|x|e-iωt,\n(13)\nwhere A, λ, and ω are positive, real constants.\n1.

      "content": "Electromagnetics\nand\nApplications\nDavid H. Staelin\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology\nCambridge, MA\nCopyright (c) 2008\n\nChapter 6: Actuators and Sensors, Motors and Generators\n\n6.1\nForce-induced electric and magnetic fields\n\n6.1.1\nIntroduction\n\nChapter 5 explained how electric and magnetic fields could exert force on charges, currents, and\nmedia, and how electrical power into such devices could be transformed into mechanical power.\nChapter 6 explores several types of practical motors and actuators built using these principles,\nwhere an actuator is typically a motor that throws a switch or performs some other brief task\nfrom time to time. Chapter 6 also explores the reverse transformation, where mechanical motion\nalters electric or magnetic fields and converts mechanical to electrical power. Absent losses,\nconversions to electrical power can be nearly perfect and find application in electrical generators\nand mechanical sensors.\n\nSection 6.1.2 first explores how mechanical motion of conductors or charges through\nmagnetic fields can generate voltages that can be tapped for power. Two charged objects can\nalso be forcefully separated, lengthening the electric field lines connecting them and thereby\nincreasing their voltage difference, where this increased voltage can be tapped for purposes of\nsensing or electrical power generation. Section 6.1.3 then shows in the context of a current-\ncarrying wire in a magnetic field how power conversion can occur in either direction.\n\n6.1.2\nMotion-induced voltages\n\nAny conductor moving across magnetic field lines acquires an open-circuit voltage that follows\ndirectly from the Lorentz force law (6.1.1)18:\n\nf = q(E + v×μoH)\n\n(6.1.1)\n\nConsider the electron illustrated in Figure 6.1.1, which has charge -e and velocity⎯v.\n\n-eE\nForce balance\n-e\n⎯H\n\n⎯\n-ev×μoH\nv\n\nFigure 6.1.1 Forces on an electron moving through electromagnetic fields.\n\n18 Some textbooks present alternative explanations that lead to the same results. The explanation here views matter\nas composed of charged particles governed electromagnetically solely by the Lorentz force law, and other forces,\nsuch as the Kelvin force densities acting on media discussed in Section 4.5, are derived from it.\n\nIt is moving perpendicular to H and therefore experiences a Lorentz force on it of -\n×\nev μoH .\nIt experiences that force even inside a moving wire and will accelerate in response to it. This\nforce causes all free electrons inside the conductor to move until the resulting surface charges\nproduce an equilibrium electric field distribution such that the net force on any electron is zero.\n\nIn the case of a moving open-circuited wire, the free charges (electrons) will move inside\nthe wire and accumulate toward its ends until there is sufficient electric potential across the wire\nto halt their movement everywhere. Specifically, this Lorentz force balance requires that the\nforce -eEe on the electrons due to the resulting electric field⎯Ee be equal and opposite to those\ndue to the magnetic field -ev×μoH , that is:\n-\n×\nev μoH = eEe\n\n(6.1.2)\nTherefore the equilibrium electric field inside the wire must be:\nE\nv\ne = -×μoH\n\n(6.1.3)\nThere should be no confusion about Ee being non-zero inside a conductor. It is the net force on\nfree electrons that must be zero in equilibrium, not the electric field Ee . The electric Lorentz\nforce qEe must balance the magnetic Lorentz force or otherwise the charges will experience a\nnet force that continues to move them until there is such balance.\n\nFigure 6.1.2 illustrates such a wire of length W moving at velocity v perpendicular to H .\nI\n+\n+\n+\nV\nR\nΦ -\n⎯H\nW\n-\n-\n⎯v,⎯f, xˆ\n\nFigure 6.1.2 Forces and voltages on a wire moving in a magnetic field.\n\nIf the wire were open-circuited, the potential Φ across it would be the integral of the electric field\nnecessary to cancel the magnetic forces on the electrons, where:\nΦ = v\nH\nμo W\n\n(6.1.4)\nand the signs and directions are as indicated in the figure. We assume that the fields, wires, and\nvelocity v in the figure are all orthogonal so that v\nH\n×μo\ncontributes no potential differences\nexcept along the wire of length W.\n\nExample 6.1A\nA large metal airplane flies at 300 m s-1 relative to a vertical terrestrial magnetic field of ~10-4\nTeslas (1 gauss). What is the open-circuit voltage V wingtip to wingtip if the wingspan W is ~40\nmeters? If B points upwards, is the right wing positive or negative?\n\nSolution: The electric field induced inside the metal is -×\nv\nH\nμo\n(4.3.2), so the induced voltage\nV = WvμoH ≅ 40×300×1.26×10-6×10-4 ≅ 1.5×10-6 volts, and the right wingtip is\npositive.\n\n6.1.3\nInduced currents and back voltages\n\nIf the moving wire of Figure 6.1.2 is connected to a load R, then current I will flow as governed\nby Ohm's law. I depends on Φ, R, and the illustrated Thevenin voltage V:\n\nI\nV\n=\n-\n(\n)\nΦ R = (\n)\nV -vμoHW R\n\n(6.1.5)\n\nThe current can be positive or negative, depending on the relative values of V and the motion-\ninduced voltage Φ. From (5.2.7) we see that the magnetic force density on the wire is\nF\nI\n= ×μoH [Nm-1]. The associated total force f be exerted on the wire by the environment and\nby H follows from (6.1.5) and is:\n\nf\nI\nbe = ×μ\n(\n)\n[\n]\no\no\nHW = xˆμ HW V -Φ R N\n\n(6.1.6)\n\nwhere the unit vector xˆ is parallel to v .\n\nEquation (6.1.6) enables us to compute the mechanical power delivered to the wire by the\nenvironment (Pbe) or, in the reverse direction, by the wire to the environment (Poe), where Pbe = -\nPoe. If the voltage source V is sufficiently great, then the system functions as a motor and the\nmechanical power Poe delivered to the environment by the wire is:\n\nP\nf\n=\noe - v = vμ HW(\n-Φ\n[\n]\noe\no\nV\n) R = Φ(V -Φ) R W\n\n(6.1.7)\n\nThe electrical power Pe delivered by the moving wire to the battery and resistor equals the\nmechanical power Pbe delivered to the wire by the environment, where I is given by (6.1.5):\n\nP\n= -I\nI2R\n[\n]\nV(\n)\n⎡\n⎤\nV\nR\n(\n)2\ne\nV +\n= -\n-Φ\n+ ⎣\n⎦\nV -Φ\nR = [\n]\n(\n)\nV\nR\n-Φ\n[\n]\n-V + (\n)\nV -Φ\n\n(6.1.8)\n= -Φ(\n)\nV\nR\n-Φ\n= P\n[\n]\nbe\nW\n\nThe negative sign in the first term of (6.1.8) is associated with the direction of I defined in Figure\n6.1.2; I flows out of the Thevenin circuit while Pe flows in. If V is zero, then the wire delivers\nmaximum power, Φ2/R. As V increases, this delivered power diminishes and then becomes\nnegative as the system ceases to be an electrical generator and becomes a motor. As a motor the\n\nmechanical power delivered to the wire by the environment becomes negative, and the electrical\npower delivered by the Thevenin source becomes positive. That is, we have a:\n\nMotor:\nIf mechanical power out Poe > 0,\n\nV > Φ = vμoHW, or v < V/μoHW\n\n(6.1.9)\n\nGenerator:\nIf electrical power out Pe > 0,\n\nV < Φ, or v > V/μoHW\n\n(6.1.10)\n\nWe call Φ the \"back voltage\" of a motor; it increases as the motor velocity v increases until\nit equals the voltage V of the power source and Pe = 0. If the velocity increases further so that\nΦ > V, the motor becomes a generator. When V = Φ, then I = 0 and the motor moves freely\nwithout any electromagnetic forces.\n\nThis basic coupling mechanism between magnetic and mechanical forces and powers can be\nutilized in many configurations, as discussed further below.\n\nExample 6.1B\nA straight wire is drawn at velocity v = xˆ 10 m s-1 between the poles of a 0.1-Tesla magnet; the\nvelocity vector, wire direction, and field direction are all orthogonal to each other. The wire is\nexternally connected to a resistor R = 10-5 ohms. What mechanical force⎯f is exerted on the wire\nby the magnetic field⎯B? The geometry is illustrated in Figure 6.1.2.\n\nSolution: The force exerted on the wire by its magnetic environment (6.1.6) is\n\n⎯fbe =⎯ I ×⎯HμoW [N], where the induced current I = -Φ/R and the back voltage\n\nΦ = vμoHW [V]. Therefore:\n\nfbe = - xˆ μoHWΦ/R = - xˆ v(μ\noHW) /R = - xˆ 10×(0.1×0.1)2/10-5 = 1 [N], opposite to⎯v.\n\n6.2\nElectrostatic actuators and motors\n\n6.2.1\nIntroduction to Micro-Electromechanical Systems (MEMS)\n\nChapter 6 elaborates on Chapter 5 by exploring a variety of motors, generators, and sensors in\nboth linear and rotary configurations. Electric examples are analyzed in Section 6.2, and\nmagnetic examples in Section 6.3. Section 6.2.1 reviews the background, while Sections 6.2.2\nand 6.2.3 explore parallel-capacitor-plate devices using linear and rotary motion respectively.\nSection 6.2.4 discusses electrostatic motors exerting forces on dielectrics, while Section 6.2.5\ndiscusses the limits to power density posed by electrical breakdown of air or other media, which\nlimits peak electric field strength.\n\nMicro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) are commonly used as motors, generators,\nactuators, and sensors and underlie one of the major current revolutions in electrical engineering,\nnamely the extension of integrated circuit fabrication technology to electromechanical systems\non the same substrate as the circuits with which they interoperate. Such devices now function as\n\noptical switches, radio-frequency switches, microphones, accelerometers, thermometers, pressure\nsensors, chemical sensors, micro-fluidic systems, electrostatic and magnetic motors, biological\nsensors, and other devices. They are used in systems as diverse as video projectors, automobile\nair bag triggers, and mechanical digital memories for hot environments.\n\nAdvantages of MEMS over their larger counterparts include size, weight, power\nconsumption, and cost, and also much increased speed due to the extremely small masses and\ndistances involved. For example, some MEMS electromechanical switches can operate at MHz\nfrequencies, compared to typical speeds below ~1 kHz for most traditional mechanical devices.\nThe feature size of MEMS ranges from sub-microns or microns up to one or more millimeters,\nalthough the basic electromagnetic principles apply to devices of any scale. Recent advances in\nmicro-fabrication techniques, such as new lithography and etching techniques, precision micro-\nmolds, and improved laser cutting and chipping tools, have simplified MEMS development and\nextended their capabilities.\n\nThe Lorentz force law (6.2.1) is fundamental to all electric and magnetic motors and\ngenerators and expresses the force vector f [Newtons] acting on a charge q [Coulombs] as a\nfunction of the local electric field E , magnetic field H , and charge velocity vector v [ms-1]:\n\nf\nq\n=\n+\n(\n)\nE\nv×μoH [Newtons]\n\n(6.2.1)\n\nFor the examples in Section 6.2 the velocities v and magnetic fields H are negligible, so the\nforce is primarily electrostatic, f\nq\n= E , and can be readily found if E is known. When E is\nunknown, the energy method of Section 5.4.2 can often be used instead, as illustrated later. The\npower densities achievable in MEMS devices can be quite high, and are typically limited by\nmaterials failures, such as electrical breakdown or ohmic overheating.\n\n6.2.2\nElectrostatic actuators\n\nThe simplest MEMS actuators use the electric force between two capacitor plates to pull them\ntogether, as illustrated in Figure 6.2.1(a) for a cantilevered loudspeaker or switch. The Lorentz\nforce density F [N m-2] attracting the two plates is given by the qE term in (6.2.1). Although\none might suppose the force density on the upper plate is simply ρsE, where ρs is the surface\ncharge density [C m-2] on that plate, the correct force is half this value because those charges\nnearer the surface screen those behind, as suggested in Figure 6.2.1(b); the charges furthest from\nthe surface perceive almost no E at all. The figure shows a one-to-one correspondence between\nelectric field lines and charges in a highly idealized distribution--reality is more random. The\nfigure shows that the average field strength E perceived by the charges is half the surface field\nEo, independent of their depth distribution ρ(z). Therefore the total attractive electric pressure is:\n\nP\nE\n(\n)\ne\ns\n= ρ\no 2\n⎡\n⎤\n⎣\n⎦\nNm-\n\n(6.2.2)\n\nFigure 6.2.1 Electrostatic MEMS switch and forces on a charged conductor.\n\nBut the boundary condition at a conductor (2.6.15) is nˆ - D = ρs , so:\n\nρ =\ns\no\nε Eo\n(6.2.3)\n\nP\nE 2\ne\no\n= ε\no\n2 ⎡\n⎤\n⎣\n⎦\nNm-\n\n(electric pressure attracting capacitor plate)\n(6.2.4)\n\nThis is the same pressure derived more rigorously in (5.2.4) and (5.4.3).\n\nIf Eo is near its breakdown value EB ≅ 108 [V m-1] for gaps less than ~10-6 meters, then the\npressure P = εoE 2\no /2 ≅ 8.8×10-12×1016/2 = 4.4×104 [N m-2]. A Newton is approximately the\ngravitational force on the apple that fell on Newton's head (prompting his theory of gravity), or\non a quarter-pound of butter. Therefore this maximum electrostatic force density is about one\npound per square centimeter, comparable to that of a strong magnet.\n\nThe cantilever acts like a spring with a spring constant k, so the total force f is simply\nrelated to the deflection x: f = kx = PA, where A is the area of the capacitor plate. Thus the\ndeflection is:\n\nx\nP\n=\n=\nA k\nε E 2\no\no A 2k [\n]\nm\n\n(6.2.5)\n\nThe ratio A/k is controlled by the composition, thickness, and length of the cantilever, and the\ndesired deflection is controlled by the application. For example, k must be adequate to overcome\nstiction19 in switches that make and break contact, and x must be adequate to ensure that the\nvoltage between the capacitor plates does not cause arcing when the switch is open.\n\nAlternatively both capacitor plates could be charged positive or negative so they repel each\nother. In this case the charge Q moves to the outside surfaces and connects to the very same\nfield strengths as before due to boundary conditions (E = Q/εoA) , except that the negative\npressure εoE2/2 on the two plates acts to pull them apart rather than together. The field between\nthe plates is then zero.\n\n19 Stiction is the force that must be overcome when separating two contacting surfaces. These forces often become\nimportant for micron-sized objects, particularly for good conductors in contact for long periods.\n\nf\narea A\ns\nV\n-\n+\nEo\n(a)\n\nEo/7 Eo/2\n(b)\nσ\nair\n\nEven with extreme electric field strengths the power density [W m-3] available with linear\nmotion MEMS actuators may be insufficient. Power equals force times velocity, and rotary\nvelocities can be much greater than linear velocities in systems with limited stroke, such as the\ncantilever of Figure 6.2.1(a) or the lateral-displacement systems illustrated in Figure 6.2.2. Since\nit is difficult to compute the lateral electric fields responsible for the lateral forces in rotary or\nlinear systems [e.g., the z components in Figure 6.2.2(a)], the energy methods described below\nare generally used instead.\n\nFigure 6.2.2 Electrostatic actuators comprising partially overlapping capacitor plates.\n\nThe two charged parallel plates illustrated in Figure 6.2.2(a) are pulled laterally toward one\nanother (z increases) because opposite charges attract. The force⎯f required to pull the plates\napart depends only on their electric charge q and the plate geometry, independent of any attached\ncircuit. This force⎯f in the -z direction can be found by noting that f does work on the\ncapacitor/circuit system, increasing its total energy wT if f is positive:\n\nf = - dwT/dz = - dwe/dz - V dq/dz [N]\n(energy-force equation)\n(6.2.6)\n\nwhere we is the electric energy stored in the capacitor, V is the capacitor voltage20, and dq is\nincremental charge flowing from any attached circuit into the positive terminal of the capacitor.\nThe negative sign in (6.2.6) results because f is in the -z direction. Since this energy-force\nequation is correct regardless of any attached circuit, we can evaluate it for an attached open\ncircuit, battery, or arbitrary Thevenin equivalent, provided it results in the given capacitor\nvoltage V and charge q.\n\nThe force computed using (6.2.6) is the same for any attached circuit and any form of the\nenergy expression (3.1.16):\n\nw = CV2/2 = q2\ne\n/2C [J]\n(electric energy in a capacitor)\n(6.2.7)\n\nThe algebra is minimized, however, if we assume the capacitor is open-circuit so that q is\nconstant and dq/dz = 0 in (6.2.6). Because V depends on z in this case, it is simpler to use we =\nq2/2C to evaluate (6.2.6), where: 1) C = εoWz/s [F], 2) the overlap area of the capacitor is Wz, 3)\nthe plate separation is s << W, and 4) we neglect fringing fields. Thus (6.2.6) becomes:\n\nf = - (q2/2) (dC-1/dz) = - (q2/2)(s/ε\n-1\noW)dz /dz = (q /2)(s/εoWz ) [N]\n\n(6.2.8)\n\n20 For convenience, V represents voltage and v represents velocity in this section.\nW\nf\nf\nV+\nW\ns\nz\n-\nf\nf\n(a)\n(b)\nL\n\nThe rapid increase in force as z → 0 results because q is constant and concentrates at the ends of\nthe plates as the overlap approaches zero; z→0 also violates the assumption that fringing fields\ncan be neglected.\n\nIt is interesting to relate the force f of (6.2.8) to the electric field strength E, where:\n\nE = ρs/εo = q/Wzεo [V m-1]\n\n(6.2.9)\n\nq = WzεoE = WzεoV/s [C]\n\n(6.2.10)\n\nf = q2s/2εoWz2 = Wsε\noE /2 = A'Pe [N]\n(lateral electric force)\n(6.2.11)\n\nwhere A' = Ws is the cross-sectional area of the gap perpendicular to⎯f, and P = ΔW\ne\ne = εoE /2 -\n0 is the electric pressure difference acting at the end of the capacitor. Note that this pressure is\nperpendicular to⎯E and is \"pushing\" into the adjacent field-free region where We = 0; in contrast,\nthe pressure parallel to⎯E always \"pulls\". Later we shall find that \"magnetic pressure\" Pm =\nΔWm is similarly attractive parallel to⎯H and pushes in directions orthogonal to⎯H.\n\nNote that if V is constant, then the force f (6.2.11) does not depend on z and is maximized as\ns→0. For a fixed V, the minimum practical plate separation s corresponds to E near the\nthreshold of electrical breakdown, which is discussed further in Section 6.2.5. Also note that the\nforce f is proportional to W, which can be maximized using multiple fingers similar to those\nillustrated in Figure 6.2.2(b). Actuator and motor designs generally maximize f and W while\npreserving the desired stroke21.\n\nExample 6.2A\nDesign a small electrostatic overlapping plate linear actuator that opens a latch by moving 1 mm\nwith a force of 10-2 Newtons.\n\nSolution: The two-plate actuator illustrated in Figure 6.2.2(a) exerts a force f = WsεoE2\n(6.2.11). If E is near the maximum dry-gas value of ~3.2×106 V m-1, the gap\ns = 1 mm, and W = 1 cm, then f = 10-2×10-3×8.85×10-12×1013 = 8.85×10-4 [N]. By\nusing M fingers, each wider than the 1-mm stroke, the force can be increased by M\n[see Figure 6.2.2(b)]. If we let M = 12 the device yields f = 1.06×10-2, but its length\nL must be greater than 12 times twice the finger width (see figure), where the finger\nwidth G must exceed not only the stroke but also several times s, in order to make\nfringing fields negligible. If G ≅ 4 mm, then the actuator length is 12×2×4 mm = 9.6\ncm, large compared to the width. A three-plate actuator with two grounded plates on\nthe outside and one charged plate inside would double the force, halve the length L,\nprotect users from electrocution, and simplify sealing the actuator against moisture\n\n21 The \"stroke\" of an actuator is its range of positions; in Figure 6.2.2(a) it would be the maximum minus the\nminimum value of z. Although the force (6.2.11) becomes infinite as the minimum z → 0 for constant q, this would\nviolate the assumption z >> d and can cause V→inf; V is usually held constant, however.\n\nthat could short-circuit the plates. The plate voltage V = Es = 3200 volts. This\ndesign is not unique, of course.\n\n6.2.3\nRotary electrostatic motors\n\nBecause forces (6.2.4) or (6.2.11) in electrostatic motors are limited by the maximum electric\nfield strength E possible without electric arcing, higher power densities [W m-3] require higher\nspeeds since the power P = fv [watts], where f is force [N], and v is velocity [m s-1]. Figure 6.2.3\npictures an ideal 4-segment rotary electrostatic motor for which v and the resulting centrifugal\nforces are ultimately limited by the tensile strength of the rotor. For both materials and\naerodynamic reasons the maximum v at the rotor tip is usually somewhat less than the speed of\nsound, ~340 m/s. Some rotors spin much faster in vacuum if the material can withstand the\ncentrifugal force.\n\nFigure 6.2.3 Four-segment rotary electrostatic motor.\n\nThis motor has radius R, plate separation s, and operating voltage V. Stationary \"stator\"\nplates occupy two quadrants of the motor and a second pair of quadrant plates (the \"rotor\") can\nrotate to yield an overlap area A = R2θ [m2] that varies from zero to πR2/2 as θ increases from\nzero to π/2. If the voltage V is applied across the plates, a torque T is produced22, where:\n\nT\nd\n= -w\n[\n]\nT dθ\nN m\n(6.2.12)\n\nand dwT is the increment by which the total system energy (fields plus battery) is increased as a\nresult of the motion dθ. The negative sign in (6.2.12) reflects the fact that the torque T is applied\nby the motor to the environment. If we replace the overlap area of Wz in (6.2.8) by its\nequivalent R2θ, then (6.2.8) and (6.2.12) become:\n\nw\nQ2\ne\no\n=\n=\n2C\nQ s 2ε R θ\n(6.2.13)\n\n22 Torque T [Nm] equals the force f on a lever times its length L. Therefore the mechanical work performed by the\ntorque is wm = fx = fL(x/L) = Tθ, where θ = x/L is the angle (radians) through which the lever rotates about its pivot\nat one end. Power is Tdθ/dt = Tω [W].\n\nstator\nrotor\nT\n+\n-\nθ\nR\nv\n+\n-\n\nT\nd\n= -w\nQ2\n2 2\n[\n]\nT\no\ndθ =\ns 2ε R θ = ε\noR V\ns\nN m\n\n(6.2.14)\n\nwhere Q = ε R2θV/s [C], which follows from (6.2.10) where Wz → R2θ [m2\no\n].\n\nIf we assume R = 10-3, s = 10-6, and V = 3 volts (corresponding to 3×106 Vm-1, below the\nbreakdown limit discussed in Section 6.2.5; then (6.2.14) yields:\n\nT = 8.8×10-12×(10-3)232/10-6 ≅ 7.9×10-11 [N m]\n\n(6.2.15)\n\nThis torque exists only until the plates fully overlap, at which time the voltage V is switched to\nzero until the plates coast another 90° and V is restored. The duty cycle of this motor is thus 0.5\nbecause T = 0 only half of the time.\n\nA single such ideal motor can then deliver an average of Tω/2 watts, where the factor 1⁄2\nreflects the duty cycle, and Tω is the mechanical power associated with torque T on a shaft\nrotating at ω radians s-1. If the tip velocity v of this rotor is 300 ms-1, slightly less than the speed\nof sound so as to reduce drag losses while maximizing ω, then the corresponding angular\nvelocity ω is v/R = 300/10-3 = 3×105 radians s-1 or ~3×106 rpm, and the available power Tω/2 ≅\n7.9×10-11 × 3×105/2 ≅ 1.2×10-5 watts if we neglect all losses. In principle one might pack\n~25,000 motors into one cubic centimeter if each motor were 10 microns thick, yielding\n~0.3 W/cm3. By using a motor with N segments instead of 4 this power density and torque could\nbe increased by a factor of N/4. The small micron-sized gap s would permit values of N as high\nas ~500 before the fringing fields become important, and power densities of ~40 W/cm-3.\n\nThis 40-W/cm3 power density can be compared to that of a 200-hp automobile engine that\ndelivers 200×746 watts23 and occupies 0.1 m3, yielding only ~1.5 W/cm3. Extremely high power\ndensities are practical only in tiny MEMS devices because heat and torque are then easier to\nremove, and because only micron-scale gaps permit the highest field strengths, as explained in\nSection 6.2.5. Rotary MEMS motors have great potential for extremely low power applications\nwhere torque extraction can be efficient; examples include drivers for micro-gas-turbines and\npumps. The field of MEMS motors is still young, so their full potential remains unknown.\n\n6.2.4\nDielectric actuators and motors\n\nOne difficulty with the rotary motor of Figure 6.2.3 is that voltage must be applied to the moving\nvanes across a sliding mechanical boundary. One alternative is to use a dielectric rotor driven by\nvoltages applied only to the stator. The configuration could be similar to that of Figure 6.2.3 but\nthe rotor would be dielectric and mounted between identical conducting stators with a potential\nV between them that is turned on and off at times so as to produce an average torque as the rotor\nrotates. Figure 6.2.4 illustrates the concept in terms of a linear actuator for which the force f can\nmore easily be found. We again assume that fringing fields can be neglected because W >> d.\n\n23 There are 746 watts per horsepower.\n\nFigure 6.2.4 Linear dielectric slab actuator.\n\nThe force f can be found by differentiating the total stored electric energy we with respect to\nmotion z, where C is the effective capacitance of this structure, and:\n\nw\ne = CV /2 = Q2/2C [J]\n\n(6.2.16)\n\nTo simplify differentiating we with respect to z, it is easier to use the expression we = Q2/2C\nbecause is this case Q is independent of z whereas C is not.\n\nFor two capacitors in parallel C = Co + Cε (3.1.14), where Co and Cε are the capacitances\nassociated with the air and dielectric halves of the actuator, respectively. Capacitance C was\ndefined in (3.1.8), and equals εA/s where A is the plate area and s is the plate separation. It\nfollows that:\n\nC = Cε + Co = εzW/s + εo(L - z)W/s = [z(ε - εo) + εoL]W/s\n\n(6.2.17)\n\nThe force f pulling the dielectric slab between the charged plates is given by the force-\nenergy relation (6.2.6) and can be combined with (6.2.16) and (6.2.17) to yield:\n\n-1\nf\nd\n≅-we\no\ndz = -d(\n)\nQ2\n2C dz = -(Q s 2W) d ⎡\n⎤\n(\n)\nε -ε\n+ ε\n⎣\n⎦\nz\noL\ndz\n\n(6.2.18)\n(\n)\n2W\n(\n)\n-2\n= Q s\n⎡\n⎤\nz ε -εo\no\n+ ε L\n(\n)\nε -εo = (\n)\nQ W 2sC2 (\n)\nε -ε\n⎣\n⎦\no [ ]\nN\n\nThis force can be expressed in terms of the electric field strength E between the two plates by\nsubstituting into (6.2.18) the expressions Q = CV and V = Es:\n\nf ≅ (E2sW/2)(ε - εo) = [(ε - εo)E2/2]Ws = ΔPeA [N]\n\n(6.2.19)\n\nwhere A = Ws is the area of the endface of the dielectric slab, and the differential electric\npressure pulling the slab between the charged plates is:\n\nΔP\ne = (ε - εo)E /2 [Nm-2]\n\n(6.2.20)\n\nThe differential pressure ΔPe pushing the interface into the capacitor is thus the difference\nbetween the electric pressure on one side of the dielectric interface and that on the other, where\nthe pressure Pe on each side is simply the electric energy density there:\n\nε\nεo\n⎯E\n+\n-\nV\nd\n\nL\n\nPe = εE2/2 [Nm-2], [Jm-3]\n\n(6.2.21)\n\nBecause the electric field at the right-hand end of the slab approaches zero, it exerts no additional\nforce. Electric pressure is discussed further in Section 5.5.2.\n\nApplying these ideas to the rotary motor of Figure 6.2.3 simply involves replacing the rotor\nby its dielectric equivalent and situating it between conducting stator plates that are excited by V\nvolts so as to pull each dielectric quadrant into the space between them. Then V is switched to\nzero as the dielectric exits that space so the rotor can coast unpowered until the dielectric\nquadrants start entering the next pair of stator plates. Thus the drive voltage V is non-zero half\nthe time, with two voltage pulses per revolution of this two-quadrant rotor. The timing of the\nvoltages must be responsive to the exact position of the rotor, which is often determined by a\nseparate rotor angular position sensor. Start-up can fail if the rotor is in exactly the wrong\nposition where f = 0 regardless of V, and the rotor will spin backwards if it starts from the wrong\nposition. Figure 6.3.6 suggests how multiple segments and excitation phases can avoid this\nproblem in the context of magnetic motors.\n\nExample 6.2B\nDesign a maximum-power-density rotary electrostatic motor that delivers 10 W power at\nω ≅ 106 r s-1 without make/break or sliding electrical contacts.\n\nSolution: A segmented dielectric rotor sandwiched between charged conducting plates avoids\nsliding electrical contacts. Assume the rotor has radius R, thickness s, and is made of\ntwo electrically insulated dielectrics having permittivities ε = 10εo and εo, and that\nthey are radially segmented as is the rotor in Figure 6.2.3, but with M segments rather\nthan 4. The maximum pressure on the edges of the rotor dielectric boundaries\nbetween ε and εo is ΔPe = (ε - εo)E2/2 [N m-2]. The mechanical power delivered\nduring the half cycle the voltages are applied to the plate is Tω = 20 = ΔPe(R/2)sMω.\nLet's arbitrarily set s = 10-6, E = 106 [V m-1], and M = 800. Therefore R =\n2×20/(sMωΔPe) = 40/[10-6×800×106×9×8.85×10-12×(106)2/2] = 1.3×10-3 [m]. The\noperating voltage is Es ≅ 1 volt and the power density is ~105 W/cm3.\n\n6.2.5\nElectrical breakdown\n\nIn every case the torque or force produced by an electrostatic MEMS actuator or motor is limited\nby the breakdown field EB = VB/d, where VB is the breakdown voltage, and the dependence of EB\non d is non-linear. Electric breakdown of a gas occurs when stray free electrons accelerated by E\nacquire enough velocity and energy (a few electron volts24) to knock additional free electrons off\ngas molecules when they collide, thus triggering a chain reaction that leads to arcing and\npotentially destructive currents. Water molecules shed electrons much more easily in collisions\nthan do nitrogen or oxygen molecules, and so EB is much lower in moist air. This is why it is\neasier to draw visible sparks in cold dry winter air than it is in summer, because in winter the\n\n24 An electron volt is the energy acquired by an electron or other equally charged particle as it accelerates through a\npotential difference of one volt. It is equivalent to e = 1.6021×10-19 Joules.\n\nfield strengths can be much greater before breakdown occurs, and such high-voltage breakdowns\nare more visible.\n\nIf, however, the gap between the two electrodes is sufficiently small, the probability\ndiminishes that an ionizing collision will occur between any free electron and a gas atom before\nthe electron hits the positively charged electrode. This mean-free-path, or average distance\nbefore a \"collision\", for free electrons is on the order of one micron in air, so breakdown is\ninhibited for gaps less than the mean free path. However, even when the gap is so narrow that\ngas breakdown is unlikely, if the field strength E is increased to ~3 × 108 [V m-1], or two orders\nof magnitude beyond typical values for EB in dry gas, any free electrons can then acquire enough\nenergy to knock an ion loose from the positively charged wall. Such a positive ion can then\nacquire enough energy to release multiple electrons when it impacts the negatively charged wall,\nproducing another form of chain reaction, electrical arcing, and breakdown.\n\nThe reasons electric actuators and motors are so attractive on the scale of MEMS, but almost\nnever used at larger scales, are therefore that: 1) the breakdown field strength EB increases\napproximately two orders of magnitude for micron-sized gaps, enabling force densities up to four\norders of magnitude greater than usual, and 2) enormous values for E and pressure can be\nachieved with reasonable voltages across micron or sub-micron gaps (⇒ ~3×108 [V m-1] and ~10\nlb/cm2).\n\nThe breakdown fields for materials are problematic because any local defect can concentrate\nfield strengths locally, exceeding the threshold. Fields of ~106 Vm-1 are a nominal upper bound,\nalthough somewhat higher values are obtained in integrated circuits.\n\n6.3\nRotary magnetic motors\n\n6.3.1\nCommutated rotary magnetic motors\n\nMost electric motors and generators are rotary because their motion can then be continuous and\nhigh velocity, which improves power density and efficiency while prolonging equipment life.\nFigure 6.3.1 illustrates an idealized motor with a rotor comprising a single loop of wire carrying\ncurrent I in the uniform magnetic field H . The magnetic field can originate from permanent\nmagnets in the stationary stator, which is the magnetic structure within which the rotor rotates,\nor from currents flowing in wires wrapped around the stator. The rotor typically has many turns\nof wire, often wrapped around a steel core with poles that nearly contact the stator along a\ncylindrical surface.\n\nThe total torque (force times radius) on the motor axle is found by adding the contributions\nfrom each of the four sides of the current loop; only the longitudinal elements of length W at\nradius r contribute, however. This total torque vector T\nf\n= ×r is the integral of the torque\ncontributions from the force density F acting on each incremental length ds of the wire along its\nentire contour C:\n\nT\nr\n=\n×\nv∫\nFds\n(torque on rotor)\n(6.3.1)\nC\n\nFigure 6.3.1 Rotary single-turn magnetic motor.\n\nThe force density F [N m-1] on a wire conveying current I in a magnetic field H follows from\nthe Lorentz force equation (5.1.1) and was given by (5.2.7):\n\nF\nI\n= ×μ H ⎡\n⎤\no\nN m-\n⎣\n⎦\n(force density on wire)\n(6.3.2)\n\nThus the torque for this motor at the pictured instant is clockwise and equals:\n\nT\n=\nμ\nzˆ rI oHW [N m]\n(6.3.3)\n\nIn the special case where H is uniform over the coil area Ao = 2rW, we can define the magnetic\nmoment M of the coil, where | M |= IAo and where the vector M is defined in a right hand\nsense relative to the current loop I . Then:\n\nT\nM\n=\n×μoH\n(6.3.4)\n\nBecause the current flows only in the given direction, H and the torque reverse as the wire\nloop passes through vertical (θ = nπ) and have zero average value over a full rotation. To\nachieve positive average torque, a commutator can be added, which is a mechanical switch on\nthe rotor that connects one or more rotor windings with one or more stationary current sources in\nthe desired sequence and polarity. The commutator reverses the direction of current at times\nchosen so as to maximize the average positive torque. A typical configuration is suggested in\nFigure 6.3.2(a) where two spring-loaded carbon brushes pass the current I to the commutator\ncontacts, which are rigidly attached to the rotor so as to reverse the current polarity twice per\nrevolution. This yields the more nearly constant torque history T(θ) illustrated by the dashed\nline in Figure 6.3.2(b). In this approximate analysis of a DC motor we assume that the time\n\nN\nS\n⎯r\nW\nθ\nH\n⎯T\n⎯f\nI\nx\ny\nz\n⎯A\n+\n-\n\nconstant L/R associated with the rotor inductance L and circuit resistance R is short compared to\nthe torque reversals illustrated in Figure 6.3.2(b).\n\nFigure 6.3.2 Commutator motor torque history and contact configuration.\n\nPower is conserved, so if the windings are lossless then the average electrical power\ndelivered to the motor, P\nV\ne =\nI , equals the average mechanical power delivered to the\nenvironment:\n\nP\nf\nm\nm\n=\n=\nvm\nm\nf rmω = Tω\n(6.3.5)\n\nwhere vm is the velocity applied to the motor load by force fm at radius rm. If the motor is driven\nby a current source I, then the voltage across the rotor windings in this lossless case is:\n\nV\nP\n=\n=\ne\nm\nI\nP\nI = Tω I\n(6.3.6)\n\nThis same voltage V across the rotor windings can also be deduced from the Lorentz force\nf\nq\n=\n+\n(\n)\nE\nv×μoH , (6.1.1), acting on free conduction electrons within the wire windings as they\nmove through H . For example, if the motor is open circuit (I ≡ 0), these electrons spinning\nabout the rotor axis at velocity v will move along the wire due to the \"qv×μoH \" force on them\nuntil they have charged parts of that wire relative to other parts so as to produce a \"qE \" force\nthat balances the local magnetic force, producing equilibrium and zero additional current. Free\nelectrons in equilibrium have repositioned themselves so they experience no net Lorentz force.\nTherefore:\n\nE\nv\n= -×μ\n-1\noH ⎡\n⎤\n⎣\n⎦\nV m\n\n(electric field inside moving conductor)\n(6.3.7)\n\nThe integral of E from one end of the conducting wire to the other yields the open-circuit\nvoltage Φ, which is the Thevenin voltage for this moving wire and often called the motor back-\n\nTorque\nπ\n2π\nθ\n(b)\nwith commutation\nwithout commutation\nstationary\nspring-loaded\ncarbon brushes\n⎯T\nθ\nI\nI\nto rotor coil\n(a)\nrotating\ncommutator\ncontacts\nI\n\nvoltage. Φ varies only with rotor velocity and H, independent of any load. For the motor of\nFigure 6.3.1, Equation (6.3.7) yields the open-circuit voltage for a one-turn coil:\n\nΦ = 2EW\n= vμo\no\nHW\n= ωrμ HW = ωAoμoH [V]\n(motor back-voltage)\n(6.3.8)\n\nwhere the single-turn coil area is Ao = 2rW. If the coil has N turns, then Ao is replaced by NAo\nin (6.3.8).\n\nThe Thevenin equivalent circuits representing the motor and its external circuit determine\nthe current I, as illustrated in Figure 6.3.3.\n\nFigure 6.3.3 Equivalent circuit for a driven motor/generator.\n\nRw is the winding resistance of the motor, where:\n\nI\nV\n=\n-\n(\n)\ns\ns\nΦ (R\nR\n+\nw )\n(motor current)\n(6.3.9)\n\nWhen the motor is first starting, ω = Φ = 0 and the current and the torque are maximum,\nwhere Imax = Vs/(Rs + Rw). The maximum torque, or \"starting torque\" from (6.3.3), where Ao =\n2rW and there are N turns, is:\n\nT\nz\nmax =\nμ\nˆ\nˆ\n2WrNImax oH = zNAoImaxμoH [Nm]\n\n(6.3.10)\n\nSince Φ = 0 when v\n=\n, IΦ = 0 and no power is converted then. As the motor accelerates\ntoward its maximum ω, the back-voltage Φ steadily increases until it equals the source voltage\nVs so that the net driving voltage, torque T, and current I → 0 at ω = ωmax. Since (6.3.8) says Φ\n= ωNAoμoH, it follows that if Φ = Vs, then:\n\nV\nV\n\nω\n=\ns\nsImax\nmax\n=\n\n(6.3.11)\nNAo o\nμ H\nTmax\n\nwhere the relation to Tmax comes from (6.3.10), and ωmax occurs at Tmin. = 0. At ωmax no power is\nbeing converted, so the maximum motor power output Pmax occurs at an intermediate speed ωp,\nas illustrated in Figure 6.3.4.\n\nRs\nVs\nI\n+\n-\nΦ\n+\n-\nRw\nmotor/generator\nexternal circuit\n+\n-\nV\n\nFigure 6.3.4 Mechanical power output Pm(ω) from a magnetic motor.\n\nAn expression for the mechanical output power Pm(ω) follows from (6.3.9):\n\nP\nT\nm\ns\n=\nω = IΦ =(\n)\nV Φ -Φ2\n(\n)\nRs + Rw\n(mechanical power out)\n(6.3.12)\n\nwhere (6.3.8) says Φ = ωNAoμoH, so Pm ∝ (Vsω - NAoμoHω2).\n\nEquation (6.3.12) says that if Vs >> Φ, which occurs for modest values of ω, then the motor\npower increases linearly with Φ and ω. Also, if Vs = 0, then Pm is negative and the device acts as\na generator and transfers electrical power to Rs + Rw proportional to Φ2 and therefore ω2.\nMoreover, if we differentiate Pm with respect to Φ and set the result to zero, we find that the\nmechanical power is greatest when Φ = Vs/2, which implies ωp = ωmax/2. In either the motor or\ngenerator case, the maximum power transfer is usually limited by currents overheating the\ninsulation or by high voltages causing breakdown. Even when no power is transferred, the back-\nvoltage Φ could cause breakdown if the device spins too fast. Semiconductor switches that may\nfail before the motor insulation are increasingly replacing commutators so the risk of excessive ω\nis often a design issue. In an optimum motor design, all failure types typically occur near the\nsame loading levels or levels of likelihood.\n\nTypical parameters for a commutated 2-inch motor of this type might be: 1) B = μoH =\n0.4 Tesla (4000 gauss) provided by permanent magnets in the stator, 2) an N = 50-turn coil on\nthe rotor with effective area A = 10-3N [m2], 3) Vs = 24 volts, and 4) Rs + Rw = 0.1 ohm. Then it\nfollows from (6.3.11), (6.3.12) for Φ = Vs/2, and (6.3.10), respectively, that:\n\nω\n=\n(\n)\n×\n-3\n-\nmax\nVs μoHAN = 24 0.4 10\n×50 =1200 rs\n[\n1] ⇒11,460 [rpm] 25\n\n(6.3.13)\n\nPmax =\nΦ\n(\n)\nV\n-\ns\nΦ\n(\n)\nR\nR\ns +\nw = Vs ⎡\n⎤\n4(R\nR\ns +\nw ) [W] =\n⎣\n⎦\n242 0.4 ≅1.4[kW]\n(6.3.14)\n\nTmax =\nμ\nAN\noHImax = AμoHVs (Rs + Rw ) = 0.05×0.4×24 0.1= 4.8 N\n[\nm]\n\n(6.3.15)\n\n25 The abbreviation \"rpm\" means revolutions per minute.\nPmax\nPm(ω)\nωp\nωmax\nω\nmotor\ngenerator\nVs > 0\nVs = 0\n\nIn practice, most motors like that of Figure 6.3.1 wrap the rotor windings around a high\npermeability core with a thin gap between rotor and stator; this maximizes H near the current I.\nAlso, if the unit is used as an AC generator, then there may be no need for the polarity-switching\ncommutator if the desired output frequency is simply the frequency of rotor rotation.\n\nExample 6.3A\nDesign a commutated DC magnetic motor that delivers maximum mechanical power of 1 kW at\n600 rpm. Assume B = 0.2 Tesla and that the source voltage Vs = 50 volts.\n\nSolution: Maximum mechanical power is delivered at ωp = ωmax/2 (see Figure 6.3.4). Solving\n(6.3.13) yields NAo = Vs/(ωmaxμoH) = 50/(2×600×60×2π×0.2) = 5.53×10-4, where\nωmax corresponds to 1200 rpm. If N = 6, then the winding area 2rW = Ao ≅\n1 cm2. To find Imax we use (6.3.14) to find the maximum allowed value of\nRs + Rw = (VsΦ - Φ2)/Pm. But when the delivered mechanical power Pmech is\nmaximum, Φ = Vs/2, so R\ns + Rw = (50×25 - 25 )/103 = 0.63Ω, which could limit N if\nthe wire is too thin. Imax = Vs/(Rs + Rw) = 50/0.63 = 80 [A]. The starting torque Tmax\n= Imax(NAo)μoH = 80(5.53×10-4)0.2 = 0.22 [N m]. This kilowatt motor occupies a\nfraction of a cubic inch and may therefore overheat because the rotor is small and its\nthermal connection with the external world is poor except through the axle. It is\nprobably best used in short bursts between cooling-off periods. The I2Rw thermal\npower dissipated in the rotor depends on the wire design.\n\n6.3.2\nReluctance motors\n\nReluctance motors combine the advantages of rotary motion with the absence of rotor currents\nand the associated rotary contacts. Figure 6.3.5 suggests a simple idealized configuration with\nonly a single drive coil.\n\nFigure 6.3.5 Two-pole single-winding reluctance motor.\n\nμ\nμ\nrotor\nstator\ngap b\nW\nN turns\nI\nθ\nradius r\n\nWhen the coil is energized the rotor is pulled by the magnetic fields into alignment with the\nmagnetic fields linking the two poles of the stator, where μ >> μo in both the rotor and stator.\nReluctance motors must sense the angular position of the rotor, however, so the stator winding(s)\ncan be excited at the right times so as to pull the passive high-μ rotor toward its next rotary\nposition, and then not retard it as it moves on toward the following attractive position. For\nexample, the current I in the figure will pull the rotor so as to increase θ, which is the overlap\nangle between the rotor and the stator poles. Once the overlap is complete the current I would be\nset to zero as the rotor coasts until the poles again have θ ≅ 0 and are in position to be pulled\nforward again by I. Such motors are efficient if hysteresis losses in the stator and rotor are\nmodest and the stator windings are nearly lossless.\n\nThe torque on such a reluctance motor can be readily calculated using (6.2.12):\n\nT\nd\n= -wT dθ [N m]\n\n(6.3.16)\n\nThe total magnetic energy wT includes wμ within the rotor and stator, wg in the air gaps between\nthem, and any energy in the power supply driving the motor. Fortunately we can simplify the\nproblem by noting that wg generally dominates, and that by short-circuiting the stator the same\ntorque exists without any power source if I remains unchanged.\n\nThe circumstances for which the gap energy dominates the total energy wT are easily found\nfrom the static integral form of Ampere's law (1.4.1):\n\nNI =\n+\nv∫(\n)\nHgap\nHstator + Hrotor -ds ≅2bHgap\n\n(6.3.17)\nC\n\nTo derive an approximate result we may assume the coil has N turns, the width of each gap is b,\nand the contour C threads the coil and the rest of the motor over a distance ~2D, and through an\napproximately constant cross-section A; D is the rotor diameter. Since the boundary conditions\nin each gap require B⊥ be continuous, μHμ ≅ μoHg, where Hμ ≅ Hstator ≅ Hrotor and Hg ≡ Hgap.\nThe relative energies stored in the two gaps and the rotor/stator are:\n\nw\ng\no\n≅\nμ\nbA(\n)\nH2\ng 2\n\n(6.3.18)\n\nw\n(\n)\nr s ≅\nμ\nDA\nHμ 2\n\n(6.3.19)\n\nTheir ratio is:\n\nw\nw\n=\nμ\n(\n)(\n)\ng\nr s\n2b\no μ\nHg Hμ\n2D = b(\n)\nμ μo\nD\n\n(6.3.20)\n\nThus wg >> wμ if b/D >> μo/μ. Since gaps are commonly b ≅ 100 microns, and iron or steel is\noften used in reluctance motors, μ ≅ 3000, so gap energy wg dominates if the motor diameter D\n<< 0.3 meters. If this approximation doesn't apply then the analysis becomes somewhat more\n\ncomplex because both energies must be considered; reluctance motors can be much larger than\n0.3 meters and still function.\n\nUnder the approximations wT ≅ wg and A = gap area = rθW, we may compute the torque T\nusing (6.3.16) and (6.3.18):26\n\nT\nd\n= -wg\no\ndθ = -bμ d(A Hg ) dθ\n\n(6.3.21)\n\nThe θ dependence of Hg can be found from Faraday's law by integrating⎯E around the short-\ncircuited coil:\n\nv\nw\n∫\n∫\nE d\n-\n=\ns\n-N\nc coil\n∫(dB dt)-da = -dΛ dt = 0\n\n(6.3.22)\nA\n\nThe flux linkage Λ is independent of θ and constant around the motor [contour C of (6.3.17)], so\nΛ, wg and T are easily evaluated at the gap where the area is A = rθW:\n\nΛ = N\nB\n∫\n-da = NBg\no\nA = Nμ HgrθW\n\n(6.3.23)\nA\n\nw\n=\nμ(\n)\ng\noHg\n2 bA = bΛ (N2μorθW)\n\n(6.3.24)\n\nT\nd\n= -wg\no\ndθ = bΛ2\n(N μ rWθ2) = r2(μ\noHg\n2)Wb [\n]\nN m\n\n(6.3.25)\n\nThe resulting torque T in (6.3.25) can be interpreted as being the product of radius r and\ntwice the force exerted at the leading edge of each gap (twice, because there are two gaps),\nwhere this force is the magnetic pressure μoH 2/2 [N m-2\ng\n] times the gap area Wb projected on the\ndirection of motion. Because the magnetic field lines are perpendicular to the direction of force,\nthe magnetic pressure pushes rather than pulls, as it would if the magnetic field were parallel to\nthe direction of force. Unfortunately, increasing the gap b does not increase the force, because it\nweakens Hg proportionately, and therefore weakens T ∝ H2. In general, b is designed to be\nminimum and is typically limited to roughly 25-100 microns by thermal variations and bearing\nand manufacturing tolerances. The magnetic field in the gap is limited by the saturation field of\nthe magnetic material, as discussed in Section 2.5.4.\n\nThe drive circuits initiate the current I in the reluctance motor of Figure 6.3.5 when the gap\narea rθW is minimum, and terminate it when that area becomes maximum. The rotor then coasts\nwith I = 0 and zero torque until the area is again minimum, when the cycle repeats.\nConfigurations that deliver continuous torque are more commonly used instead because of their\nsmoother performance.\n\n26 The approximate dependence (6.3.19) of wr/s upon A = rθW breaks down when θ→0, since wg doesn't dominate\nthen and (6.3.19) becomes approximate.\n\nFigure 6.3.6 Reluctance motor with 3 stator and 4 rotor poles.\n\nFigure 6.3.6 illustrates a reluctance motor that provides continuous torque using three stator\npoles (A, B, C) and four rotor poles (1, 2, 3, 4). When windings A and B are excited, rotor pole\n1 is pulled clockwise into stator pole B. The gap area for stator pole A is temporarily constant\nand contributes no additional torque. After the rotor moves π/9 radians, the currents are\nswitched to poles B and C so as to pull rotor pole 2 into stator pole C, while rotor pole 1\ncontributes no torque. Next C and A are excited, and this excitation cycle (A/B, B/C, C/A) is\nrepeated six times per revolution. Counter-clockwise torque is obtained by reversing the\nexcitation sequence. Many pole combinations are possible, and those with more poles yield\nhigher torques because torque is proportional to the number of active poles. In this case only one\npole is providing torque at once, so the constant torque T = bW(μoH 2\ng /2) [N m].\n\nA calculation very similar to that above also applies to relays such as that illustrated in\nFigure 6.3.7, where a coil magnetizes a flexible or hinged bar, drawing it downward to open\nand/or close one or more electrical contacts.\n\nFigure 6.3.7 Magnetic relay.\n\nWe can find the force f, flux linkage Λ, and gap energy wg using a short-circuited N-turn\ncoil to render Λ constant, as before:\n\nμ >> μo ⎯f force\nx\ngo\ngap area A\nμo\nN turns\nA\nB\nC\nπ/9\nμ >> μo\nμo\n\nf\nd\n= -wg dx\n(force closing the gap)\n(6.3.26)\n\nΛ = N\nH\nμo\ngA\n(flux linkage)\n(6.3.27)\n\nw = μ(\n)\ng\noHg\n2 A(\n)\ng\nx\no -\n= (g\nx\no -)Λ (2N2μoA) [J]\n(gap energy)\n(6.3.28)\n\nf\nd\n= -w\ndx\ng\no\n= Λ (\n)\n2N μ A = (μ H 2 2)A [\n]\no\ng\nN\n(force)\n(6.3.29)\n\nThis force can also be interpreted as the gap area A times a magnetic pressure Pm, where:\n\nPm = μoH 2\ng /2 [N/m2]\n(magnetic pressure)\n(6.3.30)\n\nThe magnetic pressure is attractive parallel to the field lines, tending to close the gap. The units\nN/m2 are identical to J/m3. Note that the minus sign is used in (6.3.29) because f is the magnetic\nforce closing the gap, which equals the mechanical force required to hold it apart; motion in the x\ndirection reduces wg.\n\nMagnetic micro-rotary motors are difficult to build without using magnetic materials or\ninduction27 because it is difficult to provide reliable sliding electrical contacts to convey currents\nto the rotor. One form of rotary magnetic motor is similar to that of Figures 6.2.3 and 6.2.4,\nexcept that the motor pulls into the segmented gaps a rotating high-permeability material instead\nof a dielectric, where the gaps would have high magnetic fields induced by stator currents like\nthose in Figure 6.3.6. As in the case of the rotary dielectric MEMS motors discussed in Section\n6.2, the timing of the currents must be synchronized with the angular position of the rotor. The\nforce on a magnetic slab moving into a region of strong magnetic field can be shown to\napproximate AμH 2\nμ /2 [N], where A is the area of the moving face parallel to Hμ, which is the\nfield within the moving slab, and μ>>μo. The rotor can also be made permanently magnetic so it\nis attracted or repelled by the synchronously switched stator fields; permanent magnet motors are\ndiscussed later in Section 6.5.2.\n\nExample 6.3B\nA relay like that of Figure 6.3.7 is driven by a current source I [A] and has a gap of width g.\nWhat is the force f(g) acting to close the gap? Assume the cross-sectional area A of the gap and\nmetal is constant around the device, and note the force is depends on whether the gap is open or\nclosed.\n\nSolution: This force is the pressure μoH 2\ng /2 times the area A (6.3.29), assuming μ >> μo. Since\n∇×H\nJ\n=\n, therefore NI =\n=\nv∫H(s) ds\nHgg + HμS, where S is the path length around\nthe loop having permeability μ. When Hgg >> HμS, then Hg ≅ NI/g and f ≅\n\n27 Induction motors, not discussed in this text, are driven by the magnetic forces produced by a combination of rotor\nand stator currents, where the rotor currents are induced by the time-varying magnetic fields they experience, much\nlike a transformer. This avoids the need for direct electrical contact with the rotor.\n\nμo(NI/g)2A/2 for the open relay. When the relay is closed and g ≅0, then Hg ≅\nμHu/μo, where Hμ ≅ NI/S; then f ≅ (μNI/S)2A/2μo. The ratio of forces when the relay\nis closed to that when it is open is (μg/μoS)2, provided Hgg >>HμS and this ratio >> 1.\n\n6.4\nLinear magnetic motors and actuators\n\n6.4.1\nSolenoid actuators\n\nCompact actuators that flip latches or switches, increment a positioner, or impact a target are\noften implemented using solenoids. Solenoid actuators are usually cylindrical coils with a\nslideably disposed high-permeability cylindrical core that is partially inserted at rest, and is\ndrawn into the solenoid when current flows, as illustrated in Figure 6.4.1. A spring (not\nillustrated) often holds the core near its partially inserted rest position.\n\nFigure 6.4.1 Solenoid actuator and fields (B and H are plotted on different scales).\n\nIf we assume the diameter of the solenoid is small compared to its length, then the fringing\nfields at the ends of the coil and core can be neglected relative to the field energy stored\nelsewhere along the solenoid. If we integrate H along contour C1 (see figure) we obtain zero\nfrom Ampere's law because no net current flows through C1 and ∂D t∂≅0 :\n\nv\nw\n∫\n∫\nH d\n-\n=\ns\n∫(\n)\nJ + ∂D ∂t - nˆ da = 0\n\n(6.4.1)\nC\nA\n\nThis implies H\n≅\noutside the solenoid unless H\nz is approximately uniform outside, a possibility\nthat is energetically disfavored relative to H being purely internal to the coil. Direct evaluation\n\n×\n×\n×\n×\n×\n×\n×\n×\n×\n×\nμo\nI\nz = D\nz\ncoil\ncore\n⎯H\nC1\nC2\nz\n-Hz\n-Bz\n(a)\n(b)\n⎯H\naxial fields\nD\nμ >> μo\nC4\nC3\n\nof H using the Biot-Savart law (1.4.6) also yields H\n≅\noutside. If we integrate H along\ncontour C2, which passes along the axis of the solenoid for unit distance, we obtain:\n\nv∫\nH d\n-\n=\ns\nNo\nz\nI = -H\n\n(6.4.2)\nC2\n\nwhere No is defined as the number of turns of wire per meter of solenoid length. We obtain the\nsame answer (6.4.2) regardless of the permeability along the contour C2, provided we are not\nnear the ends of the solenoid or its moveable core. For example, (6.4.2) also applies to contour\nC3, while the integral of⎯H around C4 is zero because the encircled current there is zero.\n\nSince (6.4.2) requires that Hz along the solenoid axis be approximately constant, Bz must be\na factor of μ/μo greater in the permeable core than it is in the air-filled portions of the solenoid.\nBecause boundary conditions require B⊥ to be continuous at the core-air boundary, H⊥ must be\ndiscontinuous there so that μHμ = μoHo, where Hμ and Ho are the axial values of H in the core\nand air, respectively. This appears to conflict with (6.4.2), which suggests H inside the solenoid\nis independent of μ, but this applies only if we neglect fringing fields at the ends of the solenoid\nor near boundaries where μ changes. Thus the axial H varies approximately as suggested in\nFigure 6.4.1(b): it has a discontinuity at the boundary that relaxes toward constant H = NoI away\nfrom the boundary over a distance comparable to the solenoid diameter. Two representative\nfield lines in Figure 6.4.1(a) suggest how⎯B diverges strongly at the end of the magnetic core\nwithin the solenoid while other field lines remain roughly constant until they diverge at the right\nend of the solenoid. The transition region between the two values of Bz at the end of the\nsolenoid occurs over a distance roughly equal to the solenoid diameter, as suggested in Figure\n6.4.1(b). The magnetic field lines⎯B and⎯H \"repel\" each other along the protruding end of the\nhigh permeability core on the left side of the figure, resulting in a nearly linear decline in\nmagnetic field within the core there; at the left end of the core there is again a discontinuity in\n|Hz| because⎯B⊥ must be continuous.\n\nHaving approximated the field distribution we can now calculate energies and forces using\nthe expression for magnetic energy density, Wm = μH2/2 [J m-3]. Except in the negligible\nfringing field regions at the ends of the solenoid and at the ends of its core, |H| ≅ NoI (6.4.2) and\nμH2 >> μoH2, so to simplify the solution we neglect the energy stored in air as we compute the\nmagnetic force fz pulling on the core in the +z direction:\n\nf\nd\nz\nT\n= -w\ndz [N]\n\n(6.4.3)\n\nThe energy in the core is confined largely to the length z within the solenoid, which has a cross-\nsectional area A [m2]. The total magnetic energy wm thus approximates:\n\nw\nA\nH2\nm ≅\nμ\nz\n2 [J]\n\n(6.4.4)\n\nIf we assume wT = wm and differentiate (6.4.4) assuming H is independent of z, we find the\nmagnetic force expels the core from the solenoid, the reverse of the truth. To obtain the correct\nanswer we must differentiate the total energy wT in the system, which includes any energy in the\n\npower source supplying the current I. To avoid considering a power supply we may alternatively\nassume the coil is short-circuited and carrying the same I as before. Since the instantaneous\nforce on the core depends on the instantaneous I and is the same whether it is short-circuited or\nconnected to a power source, we may set:\n\nv = 0 = dΛ/dt\n\n(6.4.5)\n\nwhere:\n\nΛ ≅N\nN\nψm\no\n= ∫∫μHμ -da = N z H\nμ\nμA\n\n(6.4.6)\nA\n\nHμ is the value of H inside the core (μ) and Noz is the number of turns of wire circling the core,\nwhere N is the number of turns per meter of coil length. But H = J [A m-1\no\nμ\ns\n] = NoI, so:\n\nΛ = N I\no zμA\n(6.4.7)\n\nI\nN\n= Λ (\n)\nozμA\n(6.4.8)\n\nWe now can compute wT using only wm because we have replaced the power source with a\nshort circuit that stores no energy:\n\nwT\no\n≅μH2\nμAz 2 = μ(\n)\nN I\nAz 2 = μ(\n)\nΛ μN A\n(\n)\no z\nAz 2 = Λ\nμN A\no z2\n(6.4.9)\n\nSo (6.4.9) and (6.4.6) yield the force pulling the core into the solenoid:\n\n⎡\n⎤\nμH A\ndw\n(\n\nT\nd\nΛ\nΛ/Noz)\nμ\n\nf\n[\nz = -\n= -\n⎢\n⎥=\n=\nN]\n\n(6.4.10)\ndz\ndz μN 2\no Az\nAμ\n⎢\n⎥\n⎣\n⎦\n\nwhere Hμ = H. This force is exactly the area A of the end of the core times the same magnetic\npressure μH2/2 [Nm-2] we saw in (6.3.25), but this time the magnetic field is pulling on the core\nin the direction of the magnetic field lines, whereas before the magnetic field was pushing\nperpendicular to the field lines. This pressure equals the magnetic energy density Wm, as before.\nA slight correction for the non-zero influence of μo and associated small pressure from the air\nside could be made here, but more exact answers to this problem generally also require\nconsideration of the fringing fields and use of computer tools.\n\nIt is interesting to note how electric and magnetic pressure [N/m2] approximates the energy\ndensity [J m-3] stored in the fields, where we have neglected the pressures applied from the low-\nfield side of the boundary when ε >> εo or μ >> μo. We have now seen examples where E and\nH both push or pull on boundaries from the high-field (usually air) side of a boundary, where\nboth E and H pull in the direction of their field lines, and push perpendicular to them.\n\n6.4.2\nMEMS magnetic actuators\n\nOne form of magnetic MEMS switch is illustrated in Figure 6.4.2. A control current I2 deflects a\nbeam carrying current I1. When the beam is pulled down toward the substrate, the switch (not\nshown) will close, and when the beam is repelled upward the switch will open. The Lorentz\nforce law (1.2.1) states that the magnetic force f on a charge q is qv×μoH , and therefore the\nforce density per unit length F [N m-1] on a current I\nN\n1 =\nqv induced by the magnetic field H12\nat position 1 produced by I2 is:\n\nF\nN\n=\n×\nqv μo\no\nH12 = I1×μ H\n⎡Nm-1⎤\n12 ⎣\n⎦\n\n(6.4.11)\nN is the number of moving charges per meter of conductor length, and we assume that all forces\non these charges are conveyed directly to the body of the conductor.\n\nFigure 6.4.2 Magnetic MEMS switch.\n\nIf the plate separation d << W, then fringing fields can be neglected and the I2-induced\nmagnetic field affecting current I1 is H12 , which can be found from Ampere's law (1.4.1)\ncomputed for a contour C circling I2 in a right-hand sense:\n\nv\nw\n∫\n∫\nH d\n-\n≅\ns\nH122W = ∫\nJ - nˆ da = I2\n(6.4.12)\nC\nA\nThus H\nI\n12 ≅zˆ 2 2W .

This device therefore can perform a variety of logic\nfunctions. For example, if a switch is arranged so its contacts are closed in state \"1\" when the\n\nI1\nd\nx\ny\nz\nx\ny\nz\n\nbeam is forced upward by both I1 and I2 being positive (these currents were defined in the figure\nas flowing in opposite directions), and not otherwise, this is an \"and\" gate.\nAn alternate way to derive magnetic pressure (6.4.13) is to note that if the two currents I1\nand I2 are anti-parallel, equal, and close together (d << W), then H\n=\noutside the two\nconductors and Ho' is doubled in the gap between them so WHo' = I1. That is, if the integration\ncontour C circles either current alone then (6.4.12) becomes:\nv\nw\n∫\n∫\nH d\n-\n≅\ns\nH ′o\nW =\nJ - ˆ da =\n= I2\nC\nA∫\nn\nI\n\n(6.4.14)\nBut not all electrons comprising these currents see the same magnetic field because the currents\ncloser to the two innermost conductor surfaces screen the outer currents, causing the magnetic\nfield to approach zero inside the conductors, as suggested in Figure 6.4.3.\n\nFigure 6.4.3 Surface current and force distribution in a conductor.\nTherefore the average moving electron sees a magnetic field Ho'/2, half that at the surface28.\nThus the total magnetic pressure upward on the upper beam given by (6.4.13) and (6.4.14) is:\nP\nF W\nI1\no\nμo\no\nH ′\n=\n=\n×\n2W = xˆ(H ′\n′\nW)(μoHo 2W)\n(magnetic pressure) (6.4.15)\n= μ\nxˆ\nH\n′2\n⎡\n⎤\no\no\n⎣\n⎦\nN m-\nwhere Ho' is the total magnetic field magnitude between the two conductors, and there is no\nmagnetic field on the top of the upper beam to press in the opposite direction.

In this case the magnetic energy density\ninside is W\nB\nm =\n- H 2 = 0 , and that outside, W\nH\nm\no\n= μ\n=0. Boundary conditions (2.6.5) say\nB\nH\nr\no\n⊥\n⊥\n= μo\n, where Ho⊥ is the boundary value in air. Since H// is continuous across an\ninsulating boundary and H\nr =\ninside a resting permanent magnet, H\no // =\ntoo. If an external\nH is applied to a permanent magnet, then B within that magnet is altered as suggested by the\nhysteresis diagram in Figure 2.5.3(b).\n\nThe force f [N] attracting a permanent magnet to a high-permeability material can be found\nusing:\n\nf\nd\n= wm dx\n(6.5.1)\n\nwhere x is the separation between the two, as illustrated in Figure 6.5.1, and wm is the total\nenergy in the magnetic fields [J]. The changing magnetic energy in the high-permeability\nmaterial is negligible compared to that in air because: 1) boundary conditions require continuity\nin B⊥ across the boundary so that B\nH\n⊥= μ\n⊥\n⊥\n= μoHo\n, and therefore H⊥/Ho⊥ = μo/μ << 1, and\n2) Wm [Jm-3] = μ H 2/2 where μ >> μo; thus the energy density in air is greater by ~μ/μo >> 1.\n\nFigure 6.5.1 Permanent magnet adhering to a permeable surface.\n\nSouth pole of permanent magnet\nArea A\nx\nμ>>μo\nNorth pole of permanent magnet\n⎯H\n\nThe variable magnetic energy is dominated by the energy wm in the gap, which is the energy\ndensity, Wm = μoH\ngap /2, times the volume of the gap Ax, where A is the area of the magnet face\nand x is the gap width. Thus:\n\nw\nH2\n[ ]\nm\no\n≅μ\ngapAx 2 J\n\n(6.5.2)\n\nDifferentiating w\nm with respect to x yields the attractive force f ≅ μoHgap A/2 [N], and the force\ndensity:\n\nF\nH\n≅μ\n2 = W\n= B\n2μ\n⎡J m-3⎤\no\ngap\ngap\ngap\no ⎣\n⎦\n\n(6.5.3)\n\nThis can be expressed in terms of B: F\nB\n=\ngap 2μo [Nm-2]. Note that the rest energy density\ninside the permanent magnet is zero, so it exerts no pressure. Most permanent magnets have\nmagnetic flux densities B less than one Tesla (104 gauss), so a magnet this powerful with an area\nA = 10 cm2 (~the size of a silver dollar) would therefore apply an attractive force AF =\n0.001×12/2×4π10-7 ≅ 400N (~100 pound force). A more typical permanent magnet the same size\nmight attract a steel surface with only a 10-20 pound force.\n\nIf two equal coin-shaped permanent magnets are stacked so they stick together, then they\nexperience primarily the attractive magnetic pressure B\ngap /2μo [Nm-2] associated with the gap\nbetween them, and are bonded with approximately the same force density as if one of them were\nmerely a high-permeability sheet. In this case B\nB\ngap ≅\nr , as shown in Figure 2.5.3(b).\n\nThis simple gap-based magnetic pressure model does not explain the repulsive force\nbetween two such coin magnets when one is flipped, however, for then H\ng ≅\nand wgap ≅ 0 for\nall small values of x, and dwg/dx is also ~0. In this case the energy of interest wT lies largely\ninside the magnets. This special case illustrates the risks of casually substituting simple models\nfor the underlying physical reality captured in Maxwell's equations, the Lorentz force law, and\nmaterial characteristics.\n\nPermanent magnets fail above their Curie temperature when the magnetic domains become\nscrambled. Cooling overheated permanent magnets in a strong external magnetic field usually\nrestores them. Some types of permanent magnets can also fail at very low temperatures, and\nshould not be used where that is a risk.\n\n6.5.2\nPermanent magnet motors\n\nCompact high-power-density motors often incorporate permanent magnets so current is not\nwasted on maintenance of H . For example, the stator for the rotary single-turn coil motor of\nFigure 6.3.1 could easily contain permanent magnets, avoiding the need for current excitation.\nMoreover, modern permanent magnets can provide quite intense fields, above 0.5 Tesla. In this\ncase we should also consider the effect of the rotor currents on the stator permanent magnets,\nwhereas in the earlier example we considered the stator fields and rotor currents as given. The\n\nincremental permeability of a permanent magnet varies with the applied H. If H is oriented to\nattract the stator pole and μoH > Br, then B in the permanent magnet will increase above Br (see\nFigure 2.5.3), where the incremental permeability approaches μo. To the extent the incremental\nμ > μo, some reluctance-motor torque will supplement the dominant torque studied earlier.\n\nThe permanent magnets can alternatively be placed on the rotor, avoiding the need for rotor\ncurrents or a commutator, provided the stator currents are synchronously switched instead.\nClever electronics can detect the voltage fluctuations in the stator induced by the rotor and thus\ndeduce its position, potentially avoiding the need for a separate expensive angle encoder for\nstator current synchronization.\n\nBecause different parts of permanent magnets see different B/H histories, and these depend\nin part on B/H histories elsewhere in the device, modern design of such motors or generators\nrelies extensively on complex software tools for modeling support.\n\nExample 6.5A\nTwo identical coin-shaped permanent magnets of 12-cm diameter produce 0.05 Tesla field\nperpendicular to their flat faces; one side is the north pole of the magnet and the other is south.\nWhat is the maximum force f attracting the magnets when placed face to face?\n\nSolution: Using (6.5.3) yields f = AB\ngap /2μo = π(0.06)2(0.05)2/(2×1.26×10-6) = 11.2 [N].\n\n6.6\nElectric and magnetic sensors\n\n6.6.1\nElectrostatic MEMS sensors\n\nSensors are devices that respond to their environment. Some sensors alter their properties as a\nfunction of the chemical, thermal, radiation, or other properties of the environment, where a\nseparate active circuit probes these properties. The conductivity, permeability, and permittivity\nof materials are typically sensitive to multiple environmental parameters. Other sensors directly\ngenerate voltages in response to the environment that can be amplified and measured. One\ncommon MEMS sensor measures small displacements of cantilevered arms due to temperature,\npressure, acceleration, chemistry, or other changes. For example, temperature changes can curl a\nthin cantilever due to differences in thermal expansion coefficient across its thickness, and\nchemical reactions on the surface of a cantilever can change its mass and mechanical resonance\nfrequency. Microphones can detect vibrations in such cantilevers, or accelerations along specific\naxes.\n\nFigure 6.6.1 portrays a standard capacitive MEMS sensor that illustrates the basic principles,\nwhere the capacitor plates of area A are separated by the distance d, and the voltage V is\ndetermined in part by the voltage divider formed by the source resistance Rs and the amplifier\ninput resistance R. Vs is the source voltage.\n\nFigure 6.6.1 Capacitive MEMS sensor.\n\nThe instantaneous circuit response to an increase δ in the plate separation d is an increase in\ncapacitor voltage V above its normal equilibrium value Ve determined by the voltage divider,\nwhere Ve = VsR/(R+Rs). The capacitor then discharges exponentially toward Ve with a time\nconstant τ = (R//Rs)C.29 See Section 3.5.1 for further discussions of RC circuit behavior. If Rs\n>> R then τ ≅ RC. If Rs >> R and R represents the input resistance of a high-performance sensor\namplifier, then that sensor can detect as little as Δw\n-2\nΒ ≅ 10\n0 joules per \"bit of information\"30.\nThis can be compared to the incremental increase Δwc in capacitor energy due to the\ndisplacement δ << d as C decreases to C':\n\n(\n)\n-\n(\n[\n] 1\nΔ\n=\n-\n-\nw\nC\nc\no\nC' V\n2 = V ε A d\n-d + δ\n) 2 ≅V2ε A\n2d2 [ ]\no δ\nJ\n(6.6.1)\n\nA simple example illustrates the extreme potential sensitivity of such a sensor. Assume the plate\nseparation d is one micron, the plates are 1-mm square (A = 10-6), and V = 300. Then the\nminimum detectable δ given by (6.6.1) for Δwc = ΔwΒ = 10-20 Joules is:\n\nδ\n=\nmin\nΔw\n-20\n-\n-\n-6\n\nB ×2d\nV εoA ≅10\n2(\n)\n(300 ×8.8×10\n×10\n)\n(6.6.2)\n≅\n×\n2 10-20 [\n]\nm\n\nAt this potential level of sensitivity we are limited instead by thermal and mechanical noise due\nto the Brownian motion of air molecules and conduction electrons. A more practical set of\nparameters might involve a less sensitive detector (ΔB ≅ 10-14) and lower voltages (V ≅ 5); then\nδmin ≅ 10-10 meters ≅ 1 angstrom (very roughly an atomic diameter). The dynamic range of such\na sensor would be enormously greater, of course. This one-angstrom sensitivity is comparable to\nthat of the human eardrum at ~1kHz.\n\n29 The resistance R of two resistors in parallel is R = (Ra & Rb) = RaRb/(Ra + Rb).\n30 Most good communications systems can operate with acceptable probabilities of error if Eb/No >~10, where Eb is\nthe energy per bit and No = kT is the noise power density [W Hz-1] = [J]. A bit is a single yes-no piece of\ninformation. Boltzmann's constant k ≅ 1.38×10-23 [J oK-1], and T is the system noise temperature, which might\napproximate 100K in a good system at RF frequencies. Thus the minimum energy required to detect each bit of\ninformation is ~10No = 10 kT ≅ 10-20 [J].\n+\n-\nRs\nV+\nf\nplate area A\nd\nC\nCantilevered capacitor C at V volts\nR\nVs\n\nAn alternative to such observations of MEMS sensor voltage transients is to observe\nchanges in resonant frequency of an LC resonator that includes the sensor capacitance; this\napproach can reduce the effects of low-frequency interference.\n\n6.6.2\nMagnetic MEMS sensors\n\nMicroscopic magnetic sensors are less common than electrostatic ones because of the difficulty\nof providing strong inexpensive reliable magnetic fields at microscopic scales. High magnetic\nfields require high currents or strong permanent magnets. If such fields are present, however,\nmechanical motion of a probe wire or cantilever across the magnetic field lines could produce\nfluctuating voltages, as given by (6.1.4).\n\n6.6.3\nHall effect sensors\n\nHall effect sensors are semiconductor devices that produce an output voltage VHall proportional\nto magnetic field H , where the voltage is produced as a result of magnetic forces on charge\ncarriers moving at velocity v within the semiconductor. They can measure magnetic fields or, if\nthe magnetic field is known, can determine the average velocity and type (hole or electron) of the\ncharge carriers conveying current. A typical configuration appears in Figure 6.6.2, for which the\nHall-effect voltage VHall is proportional to the current I and to the perpendicular magnetic field\nH .\n\nFigure 6.6.2 Hall effect sensor.\n\nThe operation of a Hall-effect sensor follows directly from the Lorentz force law:\n\nf\nq\n=\n+\n(\n)\nE\nv×μoH [Newtons]\n\n(6.6.3)\n\nPositively charged carriers moving at velocity v would be forced downward by f , as shown in\nthe figure, where they would accumulate until the resulting electric field E provided a\nsufficiently strong balancing force qE in the opposite direction to produce equilibrium. In\nequilibrium the net force and the right-hand side of (6.6.3) must be zero, so E\nv\n= -×μoH and\nthe resulting VHall is:\n\nV\nE\n[\n]\nHall =\n-\nxˆ\nW = vμoHW\nV\n(6.6.4)\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - -\n+ + + + + + + + + + + +\n+VHall\nW\nI\nGround\n⎯f\n⎯v\n⎯H\n⎯E\nx\ny\nz\n\nFor charge carrier velocities of 30 m s-1 and fields μoH of 0.1 Tesla, VHall would be 3 millivolts\nacross a width W of one millimeter, which is easily detected.\n\nIf the charge carriers are electrons so q < 0, then the sign of the Hall voltage is reversed.\nSince the voltage depends on the velocity v of the carriers rather than on their number, their\naverage number density N [m-1] can be determined using I = Nqv. That is, for positive carriers:\nv\nV\n=\nμ\nH\no\nW\nH ⎡\n⎤\n⎣\n⎦\nms-\n\n(6.6.5)\nN\nI\n=\nqv\n\n(6.6.6)\nThus the Hall effect is useful for understanding carrier behavior (N,v) as a function of\nsemiconductor composition.\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttp://ocw.mit.edu\n6.007 Electromagnetic Energy: From Motors to Lasers\nSpring 2011\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: http://ocw.mit.edu/terms."
