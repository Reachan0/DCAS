This course examines governance from legal, political, social, and economic perspectives. In addition, we will discuss how these structures constrain collective decision making about particular urban issues (immigration, educationâ€¦). Assignments will be nightly readings and a short paper relating an urban issue to the frameworks outlined in the class.",

Be as specific as possible. Then, analyze your topic in the context of each of the\nframeworks discussed in class. In addition, you may choose one additional framework as long as\nyou specifically define your framework and its fundamental importance. Discuss the types of\nconstraints each framework implies for your recommended actions and the types of strategies\nmost likely to be pursued when viewing the problem from the perspective of each framework.\nHow do the frameworks differ?\nBe as specific as possible. You can draw on readings from the week or outside readings, but if\nyou use other sources cite them and situate them in one of the frameworks from the week."
