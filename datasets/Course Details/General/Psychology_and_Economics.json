  "syllabus_content": "Course Meeting Times\n\nLectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session\n\nRecitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session\n\nPrerequisites\n\nAs the class is considering deviations from mainstream models of economics, a solid grasp of these models is essential for mastering the material. Therefore,\n14.01 Principles of Microeconomics\nor an equivalent introductory microeconomics course is a prerequisite for this class.\n\nReading Materials\n\nThere is no textbook for this course. The fairly detailed\nlecture slides\nare meant to be self-explanatory, and they are complemented by recitation notes as well as by a set of readings for each class, as specified in the reading list. These readings will feature in lectures, quizzes, exams, and problem sets. If a reading is marked as required, you are responsible for preparing the paper prior to class, which means reading the sections announced in class, usually the abstract, introduction, and selected sections of the paper.\n\nClass Attendance\n\nGiven that the class does not follow a textbook, most of the course materials will be based on empirical and theoretical papers from leading academic journals. While the lecture notes are fairly comprehensive, the course material will be difficult to master without attending lectures. To encourage attendance, there will be unannounced short quizzes at the start of approximately four lectures throughout the semester. These quizzes will test basic knowledge of starred readings and materials covered in the previous lecture, and they will count toward your grade for the course (see more below). If you pay attention in lectures and do the specified readings before class, the quizzes will be easy for you.\n\nScheduling Note\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, students were sent home from campus halfway through the Spring 2020 semester. The first half of the\nvideo lectures\nwere taught live on campus, but starting at the midterm review, classes were taught virtually.\n\nLaptop Policy\n\nElectronic devices may not be used in class except in the \"laptop/tablet\" seating section of the classroom in which laptops and tablets may be used. In this section, located on one side in the front of the classroom, you may use laptops or tablets for note taking. Cell phones, smart or not, are not allowed to be used in class.\n\nGrading\n\nThe class is not graded on a curve. It is possible that everyone will do very well, which will make me very happy. However, if you do not put effort into this class, you will likely not do well, i.e. you may receive a C or worse. If we think you are headed for a D or an F, we will try to warn you before the drop date. Your grade in this course will be composed of the components specified below:\n\nExams (70%):\nThere will be two closed-book, closed-notes exams. First, there will be a midterm exam in class (85 minutes), which will count for 30% of your grade. Second, there will be a cumulative end-term exam (180 minutes), which will count for 40% of your grade. If your grade on the final is higher than your grade on the midterm, both grades will be replaced with your grade on the final so that your final counts for 70% of your grade. The date for the final exam will be announced by the MIT Registrar's Office later in the semester. Please do not schedule your travels before the exam dates are announced!\n\nProblem sets (25%):\nThere will be five problem sets over the course of the semester, which will cover materials from lecture, readings, and class discussions. Late problem sets will not be accepted, and there won't be any exceptions to this policy. To accommodate for unanticipated events, illness, conflicts in your schedule, or other rational or irrational reasons that may prevent you from submitting the problem set on time, we will automatically drop the problem set with your lowest score.\n\nShort quizzes (5%):\nWe will give a few in-class quizzes at the start of lecture. These quizzes will be brief, non-technical checkups on your knowledge of what's going on in the class (readings, lectures, problem sets). The quizzes are meant to help you to keep up with the materials of the course throughout the semester. I may also cold call in class to help overcome your natural shyness and ward off your natural sleepiness. However, given the large class size, there won't be a class participation grade.\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\nIn this class, you will be held to the high standard of academic integrity expected of all students at MIT.\n\nWe will follow MIT's Academic Integrity Policy (see complete policy at\nIntegrity at MIT\n).\n\nYou may work jointly with other groups on problem sets but each of you must submit solutions individually. If you choose to work with other students, we expect that you work jointly on the solutions rather than simply copying solutions from another student. This will help you to learn the material and to prepare for exams.\n\nYou must work without other students, without books, and without notes on all quizzes and exams.\n\nViolating the Academic Integrity policy in any way will result in official Institute sanction.\n\nPlease review the Academic Integrity Policy and related resources, and contact us if you have any questions related to the academic integrity of this course.\n\nCheck\n\nCheck. Great, you are still reading! To confirm that you indeed read the syllabus, please send an email with a picture of a bear to Prof. Schilbach with the subject line \"14.13 confirmation.\" Please send interesting pictures, not just the first one that shows up when googling \"bear.\" (Note: This was for enrolled MIT students only, not for OCW learners.)\n\nCalendar\n\nLectures 1-2: Introduction and Overview\n\nLectures 3-4: Time Preferences (Theory)\n\nLectures 5-6: Time Preferences (Applications)\n\nLectures 7-8: Risk Preferences\n\nLecture 9: Reference-Dependent Preferences\n\nLectures 10-13: Social Preferences\n\nIn-Class Midterm Exam\n\nLecture 14: Limited Attention\n\nLectures 15-16: Utility from Beliefs: Learning\n\nLecture 17: State-Dependent Preferences, Projection, and Attribution Bias\n\nLecture 18: Gender, Discrimination, and Identity\n\nLecture 19: Defaults, Nudges, and Frames\n\nLecture 20: Malleability and Inaccessibility of Preferences\n\nLecture 21: Poverty through the Lens of Psychology\n\nLecture 22: Happiness and Mental Health\n\nLecture 23: Policy with Behavioral Agents\n\nLecture 24: Behavioral Economics and COVID-19",

Writing only a numeric answer to the question is not enough to receive full credit!\nTotal: 60 points.\nQuestion 1: Estimating Yearly Discount Factors (10 Points)\nIn this question you should assume that δ is defined for a year and that a year is 365 days. You should\nalso assume that β is defined for a time unit of a day, so that anything that is in the future for the purpose\nof the question is discounted by β (be it a day from now or a year from now), times the relevant amount of\nδ (i.e. δtime in years).\nPaul is a human being. Richard is a behavioral economist trying to understand Paul's preferences.\nRichard asks Paul: how much money tomorrow makes you indifferent with 10 dollars right now? Paul\nanswers: 11 dollars.\n1. (2 points) First, Richard makes the assumption that Paul has very simple preferences over time: he\nassumes that Paul is an exponential discounter. What is Paul's implied yearly discount factor δ given\nhis answer?\n2. (2 points) Next, Richard assumes that Paul is a quasi-hyperbolic discounter with β = 0.91. What is\nPaul's implied yearly discount factor δ given his answer?\nWhen Richard gets back to his office, he regrets not having asked Paul: how much money two years\nfrom now makes you indifferent with 100 dollars one year from now?\n3. (2 points) What would Paul have answered if he was in fact an exponential discounter?\n4. (2 points) What would Paul have answered if he was in fact a quasi-hyperbolic discounter with β = 0.91?\n5. (2 points) After this thought exercise, what do you think is a more plausible model of Paul's time\npreferences (or of anyone who is indifferent between 10 dollars right now and 11 dollars tomorrow)?\nProblem 2: Optimal laptop policy in class (20 Points)\nIn Lecture 1, I introduced a policy problem: \"What is the socially optimal policy regarding laptops (and\nother electronic devices) in 14.13?\" I'll refer to this in shorthand as the 'laptop policy.' Note that we are\nonly deciding about the laptop policy for our own course, 14.13. Assume that all other courses have their\nown (independent) laptop policies.\nFor the purposes of this problem set, let's use a Utilitarian criterion for social optimality (where the\ntargets of the Utilitarian analysis are MIT students). In other words, the socially optimal laptop policy\nis the policy that maximizes the average welfare of all MIT students. As you analyze the laptop problem,\nremember that you are contemplating any possible laptop policy in 14.13, not necessarily the one that was\nactually chosen.\n\n1. (5 points) Explain why a laptop policy in 14.13 has potential welfare implications for MIT students who\nend up dropping the class rather than only for the ones who actually enroll in the class. Why might we\nconcern ourselves with students who do not end up enrolling in the class? Why does the existence and\nbehavior of these non-enrollees influence the socially optimal laptop policy?\nLet us now consider the following potential polices:\n(a) Laissez-faire, i.e. no restrictions - let students do whatever they wish to do.\n(b) Ban laptops for everyone.\n(c) Make the no-laptop section the default and allow students to opt out (of the no-laptop section).\n(d) Make the laptop section the default and allow students to opt out (of the laptop section).\n(e) Set up an active choice between the laptop and no-laptop sections.\n2. (10 points) Select your most and least preferred policy and discuss, for each of them, one classical\neconomics and one psychological reason for or against them, as opposed to the course actual policy.\n3. (5 points) How would you go about measuring the effects of your preferred policy relative to the course's\nactual policy or other potential policies? Assume that you have unlimited resources for this policy\nevaluation exercise.\nQuestion 3: Procrastination of 14.13 problem sets (30 Points)\nAmy, Jack, Bob and Carol are students in 14.13. Suppose the deadline for their first problem set is ap\nproaching --it is due in 3 days from today, so they can do the problem set on any of four days, t = 1, 2, 3, 4\n(where t = 1 is today).\nThe instantaneous utility costs of doing the problem set in periods t = 1, 2, 3, and 4 are 9, 20, 30, and\n40 utils, respectively, as shown in Table 1 (note that all these are negative). Assume that the problem set\ntakes only one day to complete, late submissions are not an option, and the world ends if the problem set is\nnot finished at all, i.e. at the beginning of day t = 4, if the problem set is finished by then, the student will\nbegin, finish, and turn it in on day t = 4.\nPeriod t\nu(Psett = 0)\nu(Psett = 1)\n-9\n-20\n-30\n-40\nTable 1: Instantaneous utility of (not) doing the problem set\nEach student's utility function is as follows:\n(\nP4\nδτ -t\nu(Psett) + β\nu(Psetτ ) for 1 ≤ t ≤ 3,\nτ=t+1\nUt =\n(1)\nu(Psett)\nfor t = 4.\nwhere u(Psett) is the (negative) instantaneous utility of doing the problem set on day t with Psett = 1 if the\nstudent works on the problem set in period t and Psett = 0 if the student does not work on the problem set\nin period t.\n1. (2 points) Briefly explain this utility function. What do the parameters β and δ measure? What do we\ntypically assume about these parameters?\n2. (2 points) Amy is an exponential discounter with β = 1, δ = 1, i.e. she does not discount the future at\nall. When will Amy do the problem set?\nPage 2\n\n3. (2 points) Jack is an exponential discounter with β = 1, δ = 1/2. When will Jack do the problem set?\nExplain in words why Jack and Amy do the problem set at different times.\n4. (3 points) Bob is a fully naive hyperbolic discounter with β = 1\n4, δ = 1, and β ˆ = 1. That is, Bob is\npresent-biased, but he does not take into account his future present bias when making decisions. When\nwill Bob do the problem set?\n5. (2 points) On day 0 (before day 1), if you ask Bob when he'll get the problem set done, what will he\npredict - assuming that he is too busy on day 0 so that day 0 itself is not an option?\n6. (3 points) Carol is a fully sophisticated hyperbolic discounter with β = 1\n4, δ = 1, and ˆβ = β = 1\n4.\nThat is, Carol is present-biased, but she fully takes into account her future present bias when making\ndecisions. When will Carol do the problem set? Explain in words why Carol and Bob do the problem\nset at different times.\n7. (4 points) Marlon is a partially naive hyperbolic discounter with β = 1\n4, δ = 1, and β ˆ = 4 . Marlon is\npresent-biased and has illusions about his amount of present bias at future periods. When will Marlon\ndo the problem set? (Hint: According to the partial naivet model, at each period Marlon predicts his\nfuture behavior to be that of a fully sophisticated hyperbolic discounter with discount factor βˆ.\nSuppose now that a big snowstorm is announced for days 3 and 4. Doing the pset during the snowstorm\nis even worse because everybody else can go skiing/snowshoeing. Only Marlon is unaffected because\nhe misses the warm weather of Sicily and hates going out in the snow, thus we will ignore him for\nthis question. For everyone else, the instantaneous utility costs of doing the problem set in periods\nt = 1, 2, 3, 4 is now 9, 20, 84 and 88, and everyone perfectly anticipates these utility costs from Day 0.\n8. (2 points) When will Bob do the problem set?\n9. (2 points) Does the snowstorm affects Bob's long-term utility, as evaluated by his period t = 0 self? In\nwhat direction? No action can be taken in period t = 0 - think of period t = 0 as a very busy day.\n10. (2 points) When does Carol do the pset? How is her long-term utility (from day 0) affected by the\nsnowstorm? Why?\nNow suppose that a Californian tech startup, SnowBiz, can trigger or prevent a snowstorm for a fee.\n11. (2 points) On day 0, SnowBiz goes and asks Bob whether he wants to pay them to create the snowstorm\ndescribed in question 8. Is Bob willing to pay anything for this snowstorm? What could SnowBiz do to\nincrease his willingness to pay?\n12. (2 points) On day 0, SnowBiz goes and asks Carol whether she wants to pay them to prevent the\nsnowstorm. How much is Carol willing to pay? Assume that 1 util in day 0 is worth 1 dollar.\n13. (2 points) Why are things so different for Carol and Bob? Think of the snowstorm as a commitment\ndevice. Why is it the case that it helps Bob but it hurts Carol? What is the lesson here about commitment\ndevices?\nPage 3\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n14.13 Psychology and Economics\nSpring 2021\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Hyperbolic discounting thus does a better job at explaining preferences\nof someone who is indifferent between 10 dollars today and 11 dollars the next day!\nProblem 2: Optimal laptop policy in class (20 Points)\nIn Lecture 1, I introduced a policy problem: \"What is the socially optimal policy regarding laptops (and\nother electronic devices) in 14.13?\" I'll refer to this in shorthand as the 'laptop policy.' Note that we are\nonly deciding about the laptop policy for our own course, 14.13. Assume that all other courses have their\nown (independent) laptop policies.\nFor the purposes of this problem set, let's use a Utilitarian criterion for social optimality (where the\ntargets of the Utilitarian analysis are MIT students). In other words, the socially optimal laptop policy\nis the policy that maximizes the average welfare of all MIT students. As you analyze the laptop problem,\nremember that you are contemplating any possible laptop policy in 14.13, not necessarily the one that was\nactually chosen.\n1. (5 points) Explain why a laptop policy in 14.13 has potential welfare implications for MIT students who\nend up dropping the class rather than only for the ones who actually enroll in the class. Why might we\nconcern ourselves with students who do not end up enrolling in the class? Why does the existence and\nbehavior of these non-enrollees influence the socially optimal laptop policy?\nSolution: The key issue here is selection into enrollment. Frank cares about the welfare of all\nstudents who are potentially interested in taking the course to the extent that a laptop policy may\naffect who ends up taking the course from among those students.\n- On the one hand, the policy may deter some of these students (e.g., students who have a strong\npreference for using a laptop in class). For example, suppose a student hurt her thumb during\nthe winter break, so she can only take notes using a laptop. If the laptop policy of the course\nprohibits any use of laptops, the student will have to drop the course even though she is very\ninterested in the course material.\n- On the other hand, the policy may attract additional students (e.g., students who have par\nticularly strong self-control problems and are aware they have these problems).\nIf we only look at the welfare impact of the policy on students who enroll in the course, we will miss\nthe welfare loss due to selection into (or out of) the course. Therefore, the socially-optimal laptop\npolicy in 14.13 should maximize the welfare of all students who are interested in taking the course\n(i.e. all potential enrollees).\n[The sign of the selection effect is unclear, for two reasons. First, the policy might induce students\nto select into or out of the course. Second, students might be better or worse off by taking 14.13\ncompared to their outside option (i.e. taking another class, or just taking one less class).]\nPage 2\n\nLet us now consider the following potential polices:\n(a) Laissez-faire, i.e. no restrictions - let students do whatever they wish to do.\n(b) Ban laptops for everyone.\n(c) Make the no-laptop section the default and allow students to opt out (of the no-laptop section).\n(d) Make the laptop section the default and allow students to opt out (of the laptop section).\n(e) Set up an active choice between the laptop and no-laptop sections.\n2. (10 points) Select your most and least preferred policy and discuss, for each of them, one classical\neconomics and one psychological reason for or against them, as opposed to the course actual policy.\nSolution: Many answers are possible here. Let us first discuss a few of the economic or psychological\neffects of different policies:\n(i) 'Classical economics' effect 1: Some students find it useful to take notes using a laptop,\nor they might even be able to successfully multitask (e.g., doing psets for other classes while\nlistening to the 14.13 lecture). These students will personally benefit from policies that allow\nthe use of laptops in class.\n(ii) 'Classical economics' effect 2: Some students might care about the environment. Using\nlaptops in class will increase power use, but (perhaps) save some paper.\n(iii) 'Psychological' effect 1: There might be attention-related externalities from laptop use for\nother students. That is, some students might find it distracting if students around or in front\nof them use laptops during class. These students will personally benefit from policies that do\nnot allow the use of laptops in class (as this reduces such distractions for them).\n(iv) 'Psychological' effect 2: Some students face self-control problems while taking notes on\ntheir laptops. They might want to start checking their Facebook pages, or chat with their\nfriends in class. Such students will generally benefit from policies that reduce laptop use in\nclass. Sophisticated quasi-hyperbolic discounters will commit not to use laptops in class in the\nfuture (if that is an option). In contrast, naive hyperbolic students might allow their future\nselves to use laptops, since they underestimate the negative effects of having distracting options\navailable to them (since they overestimate their future level of self-control).\n(v) 'Psychological' effect 3: A similar, but distinct effect is that some students might underes\ntimate the negative impact that multi-tasking in class has on them. That is, these students\nmight think that they are perfectly able to do a pset for another class while listening to lectures\nat the same time, while in fact that's very difficult to do.\n(vi) 'Psychological' effect 4: People are generally opposed to 'hard paternalism'. That is, they\nmight prefer any given outcome more if they have chosen this outcome themselves (e.g. if they\nchose not to use laptops) compared to a situation in which the outcome is imposed on them\n(e.g. by a laptop ban).\nLet us now briefly discuss the different policies in light of these effects:\n(a) Laissez-faire has no effect on exponential discounting students, but will it hurt quasi-hyperbolic\ndiscounters or students who underestimate the negative impact of multi-tasking for other rea\nsons. Students like Bob and Carol will have self-control problem and will be tempted to use the\nlaptops at the cost of future grade decreases. Moreover, even in the absence of psychological\neffects, laissez-faire will not lead to the social optimum of laptop use since students will likely\nnot internalize the externalities they impose on others. That is, some students might choose to\nuse a laptop in class because it is good for them personally, and ignore any negative impact on\nother students.\nPage 3\n\n(b) A laptop ban will hurt exponential discounters who value the use of laptops in class. However,\nrelative to laissez-faire, it will help students who underestimate the negative impact of laptops\non them. Moreover, it will help students who suffer from the externalities caused by others'\nlaptop use. Finally, it might also be good for the environment, depending on the environmental\ndamage caused by laptop power use vs. printing.\n(c) A laptop default will help conquer the shortcomings of both policies above as it allows students\nto sort into the section that might be best for them. Moreover, some students might appreciate\nthe ability to choose for themselves compared to hard paternalism. However, there might be\nsub-optimal sorting given that some students will forget to opt out. Moreover, quasi-hyperbolic\ndiscounters might not opt out due to present bias, given that opting out entails (small) upfront\ncosts, but yields only delayed benefits. Naive students might not opt out, given that they don't\nunderstand the benefits of doing so (plus there is a small cost to opting out). Finally, students\nwho are particularly affected by externalities can now sort to the other side of the classroom\n(the no-laptop section).\n(d) A no-laptop default is very similar to a laptop default. The difference here is that students\nwho miss the sign-up deadline will end up in the no-laptop section. Moreover, naive students\nmight not sign up to avoid incurring the small immediate costs, which may turn out to be good\nfor them. Students might also interpret the default as a suggested choice and therefore stick\nwith that choice (regardless of whether it is good for them). If we think that laptop use is\ninefficiently high due to the externality, choosing a no-laptop default might be preferred to a\nlaptop default.\n(e) Active choice is quite similar to the two previous default options. Students are now forced to\nmake a choice now, and none of the two options is a priori favored by the small opt-out costs.\nHowever, this policy might be hard to implement since some of the students may not respond,\nin which case the TA will not know what their choices are.\n3. (5 points) How would you go about measuring the effects of your preferred policy relative to the course's\nactual policy or other potential policies? Assume that you have unlimited resources for this policy\nevaluation exercise.\nSolution: With unlimited resources, we could conduct a randomized-controlled trial to measure\nthe degree of success of the different policies.\nTo do so, we can randomly divide a sample of students into two groups, force all students to stay\nin the course (so as to avoid selection issues), teach the course to the two groups with different\nlaptop policies, and measure the outcomes of interest. To increase the sample size, we could run\nthis experiment for many years or at different schools.\nOutcomes of interest could be grades (in 14.13 and perhaps other courses), student satisfaction with\nthe course (from course evaluations), and student happiness (from surveys).\nIf we wanted to understand the selection margin (and if forcing students to take the course is not\npossible), we'd have to randomize the offer to take 14.13 with different policies, and then measure\nstudents' outcomes among students who are offered the class under a particular policy compared to\nstudents' outcomes among students who are offered the class under a different policy.\nQuestion 3: Procrastination of 14.13 problem sets (30 Points)\nAmy, Jack, Bob and Carol are students in 14.13. Suppose the deadline for their first problem set is ap\nproaching --it is due in 3 days from today, so they can do the problem set on any of four days, t = 1, 2, 3, 4\nPage 4\n\n(where t = 1 is today).\nThe instantaneous utility costs of doing the problem set in periods t = 1, 2, 3, and 4 are 9, 20, 30, and\n40 utils, respectively, as shown in Table 1 (note that all these are negative). Assume that the problem set\ntakes only one day to complete, late submissions are not an option, and the world ends if the problem set is\nnot finished at all, i.e. at the beginning of day t = 4, if the problem set is finished by then, the student will\nbegin, finish, and turn it in on day t = 4.\nPeriod t\nu(Psett = 0)\nu(Psett = 1)\n-9\n-20\n-30\n-40\nTable 1: Instantaneous utility of (not) doing the problem set\nEach student's utility function is as follows:\n(\nP4\nδτ -t\nu(Psett) + β\nu(Psetτ ) for 1 ≤ t ≤ 3,\nτ=t+1\nUt =\n(1)\nu(Psett)\nfor t = 4.\nwhere u(Psett) is the (negative) instantaneous utility of doing the problem set on day t with Psett = 1 if the\nstudent works on the problem set in period t and Psett = 0 if the student does not work on the problem set\nin period t.\n1. (2 points) Briefly explain this utility function. What do the parameters β and δ measure? What do we\ntypically assume about these parameters?\nSolution: The student's utility comes from the costs of doing the problem set. She can incur these\ncosts in the present if she does the problem set today, or in the future if she does the problem set\nin the future. Notably, the student does not care about costs incurred in the past.\nβ is the short-term discount factor and captures the student's degree of present bias. δ is the long\nterm discount factor. A large body of evidence suggests that people are more patient in tradeoffs\ninvolving only future periods than in tradeoffs that involve the present.\nWe usually assume both β and δ are between 0 and 1, with β < 1 for present-biased individuals,\nand β = 1 for exponential discounters. δ is usually assumed to be close to 1.\n2. (2 points) Amy is an exponential discounter with β = 1, δ = 1, i.e. she does not discount the future at\nall. When will Amy do the problem set?\nSolution: Amy will do the problem set at t = 1.\nAt t = 1, Amy's choice set is to do the problem set at t = 1, 2, 3, or 4. Because she is an exponential\ndiscounter, she knows that her future selves will follow through with whatever choice she makes at\nt = 1. As a result, she can simply choose whatever option maximizes U1, i.e. she chooses doing the\npset at t = 1.\nDo the pset at\nt = 1\nt = 2\nt = 3\nt = 4\nU1\n-9\n-20\n-30\n-40\nPage 5\n\n3. (2 points) Jack is an exponential discounter with β = 1, δ = 1/2. When will Jack do the problem set?\nExplain in words why Jack and Amy do the problem set at different times.\nSolution: Jack will do the problem set at t = 4.\nAt t = 1, Jack's choice set is to do the problem set at t = 1, 2, 3, or 4. Because he is an exponential\ndiscounter, he knows that her future selves will follow through with whatever choice he makes at\nt = 1 (you can check that by computing his choice problem at each subsequent time). As a result,\nhe can simply choose whatever option maximizes U1, i.e. he chooses doing the pset at t = 4, he\nvastly discounts the future cost of doing the pset.\nDo the pset at\nt = 1\nt = 2\nt = 3\nt = 4\nU1\n-9\n-10\n-7.5\n-5\nJack heavily discounts the future, in a time-consistent way. Even though the instantaneous cost\nincreases over time, these increments in cost are not steep enough to make him want to do the pset\nuntil Day 4. He simply chooses to do the pset on Day 4 in the first place and stick to this plan.\nAmy does not discount the future at all so she does the pset at the lowest-cost period, which is Day\n1.\n4. (3 points) Bob is a fully naive hyperbolic discounter with β =\n, δ = 1, and β ˆ = 1. That is, Bob is\npresent-biased, but he does not take into account his future present bias when making decisions. When\nwill Bob do the problem set?\nSolution: Bob will do the problem set at t = 4.\nBob is a fully-naive hyperbolic discounter. In each period, starting at t = 1, he solves his utility\nmaximization problem, assuming that he will stick to his choices in the future.\nBob's t = 1 self discounts all future disutilities. As a result, he plans to do the pset at t = 2:\nDo the pset at\nt = 1\nt = 2\nt = 3\nt = 4\nU1\n-9\n-5\n-7.5\n-10\nSimilarly, Bob's t = 2 self discounts all future disutilities (from the perspective of t = 2). Since\nthe costs of doing it at t = 2 are not discounted anymore, he now prefers to do the pset at t = 3.\nThis is because in contrast to t = 2, t = 3 is still in the future and therefore Bob discounts the\ninstantaneous utility from this period using β. As a result, Bob surprises himself by not doing the\npset at t = 2 as planned. Bob is time-inconsistent.\nDo the pset at\nt = 1\nt = 2\nt = 3\nt = 4\nU2\n-\n-20\n-7.5\n-10\nThe same thing happens t = 3. Bob now doesn't discount the costs of doing it immediately (at\nt = 3) anymore, such that he now prefers to wait until t = 4. As a result, he doesn't do it at t = 3\nand ends up doing it at t = 4.\nDo the pset at\nt = 1\nt = 2\nt = 3\nt = 4\nU3\n-\n-\n-30\n-10\nPage 6\n\n5. (2 points) On day 0 (before day 1), if you ask Bob when he'll get the problem set done, what will he\npredict - assuming that he is too busy on day 0 so that day 0 itself is not an option?\nSolution:\nAt day 0, all possible dates of completion are in the future and they are therefore discounted all\nequally. Bob would thus plan to do the problem set on day 1 (but will surprise himself not doing\nso).\nDo the pset at\nt = 1\nt = 2\nt = 3\nt = 4\nU0\n-2.25\n-5\n-7.5\n-10\n6. (3 points) Carol is a fully sophisticated hyperbolic discounter with β = 1 , δ = 1, and β ˆ = β = 1 .\nThat is, Carol is present-biased, but she fully takes into account her future present bias when making\ndecisions. When will Carol do the problem set? Explain in words why Carol and Bob do the problem\nset at different times.\nSolution:\nCarol will do it at t = 1.\nCarol is a fully-sophisticated hyperbolic discounter. She has a rational expectation, i.e. she fully\nunderstands her future present bias. Taking into account her future choice, she solves her utility\nmaximization problem by backward induction.\nAt t = 4, she has no choice but to do the problem set then (since otherwise the world will end).\nDo the pset at\nt = 1\nt = 2\nt = 3\nt = 4\nU4\n-\n-\n-\n-40\nAt t = 3, she heavily discounts the future (period t = 4), so she prefers to do the pset at t = 4.\nThat is, she doesn't do it at t = 3.\nDo the pset at\nt = 1\nt = 2\nt = 3\nt = 4\nU3\n-\n-30\n-10\nSimilarly, at t = 2, she heavily discounts the future, i.e. periods t = 3 and t = 4. If she could be\nsure that she'd actually do the pset at t = 3, she would prefer to wait until then. However, she\nanticipates her choice at t = 3 (which is to wait until t = 4) correctly, such that, effectively, at t = 2\nshe chooses between doing the pset at t = 2 or at t = 4. Waiting until t = 4 is still preferrable from\nher point of view, thus she does not do it at t = 2.\nDo the pset at\nt = 1\nt = 2\nt = 3\nt = 4\nU2\n-\n-20\n-7.5\n-10\nAnticipating her future choices, at t = 1, she effectively chooses between doing the pset at t = 1 or\nat t = 4, so she decides to do it at t = 1.\nDo the pset at\nt = 1\nt = 2\nt = 3\nt = 4\nU1\n-9\n-5\n-7.5\n-10\nPage 7\n\nBob and Carol do the problem set at different times because Bob is naive while Carol is sophisticated.\nBob's naivet e means that in period 1, he wrongly anticipates to do the pset in period 2, and thus is\nhappy to procrastinate. Carol, instead, realized she would also procrastinate in period 2 and would\nreally only do the pset in period 4. Armed with this correct prediction, she prefers to do the pset\nright away on Day 1.\n7. (4 points) Marlon is a partially naive hyperbolic discounter with β = 1\n4, δ = 1, and β ˆ = 4 . Marlon is\npresent-biased and has illusions about his amount of present bias at future periods. When will Marlon\ndo the problem set? (Hint: According to the partial naivet e model, at each period Marlon predicts his\nfuture behavior to be that of a fully sophisticated hyperbolic discounter with discount factor βˆ.\nSolution:\nMarlon will do it at t = 4.\nMarlon also solves his utility maximization problem by backwards induction, but he reasons about\nhis future self as if he was going to become \"Super Marlon\" with β =\n.\nAt t = 4, True Marlon and Super Marlon would both have no choice but to do the problem set then\n(since otherwise the world will end).\nDo the pset at\nt = 1\nt = 2\nt = 3\nt = 4\nU4\n-\n-\n-\n-40\nAt t = 3, True Marlon heavily discounts the future (period t = 4), so he prefers to do the pset at\nt = 4.

He thinks that if\nhe waits, he will become Super Marlon in period 3 and do the pset then. Thus his decision now is\ndoing the pset in period 2 VS doing the pset in period 3 (he does not realize that if he waits, he will\nactually only do it in period 4). Waiting until t = 3 is preferable from True Marlon's point of view,\nthus he does not do it at t = 2.\nDo the pset at\nt = 1\nt = 2\nt = 3\nt = 4\nU2\n-\n-20\n-7.5\n-10\nAt t = 2, Super Marlon would not discount the future as much. Super Marlon would prefer to do the\npset immediately than to wait. (Note that this is not relevant here, but Super Marlon anticipates\nto be Super Marlon in subsequent periods, so he is comparing doing the pset now VS in period 3.\nThis is because Super Marlon from period 2 is just a fiction in the mind of True Marlon of period\n1, who believes he will be Super Marlon forever.)\nPage 8\n\nDo the pset at\nt = 1\nt = 2\nt = 3\nt = 4\nˆ\n-\n-20\n-24\n-32\nAt t = 1, True Marlon is considering doing the pset now VS doing it in period 2, since he thinks he\nwill then become Super Marlon. Marlon thus waits, and surprises himself in period 2 by not doing\nthe pset, and then again in period 3.\nDo the pset at\nU2\nt = 1\nt = 2\nt = 3\nt = 4\nU1\n-9\n-5\n-7.5\n-10\nSuppose now that a big snowstorm is announced for days 3 and 4. Doing the pset during the snowstorm\nis even worse because everybody else can go skiing/snowshoeing. Only Marlon is unaffected because\nhe misses the warm weather of Sicily and hates going out in the snow, thus we will ignore him for\nthis question. For everyone else, the instantaneous utility costs of doing the problem set in periods\nt = 1, 2, 3, 4 is now 9, 20, 84 and 88, and everyone perfectly anticipates these utility costs from Day 0.\n8. (2 points) When will Bob do the problem set?\nSolution: Bob will do the problem set at t = 2.\nBob's t = 1 self discounts all future disutilities. He plans to do the pset at t = 2.\nDo the pset at\nt = 1\nt = 2\nt = 3\nt = 4\nU1\n-9\n-5\n-21\n-22\nAt t = 2, because the snowstorm makes future pset prospects much worse, he actually stick to this\nplan. Making the future worse helps him overcome procrastination.\nDo the pset at\nt = 1\nt = 2\nt = 3\nt = 4\nU1\n-9\n-20\n-21\n-22\n9. (2 points) Does the snowstorm affects Bob's long-term utility, as evaluated by his period t = 0 self? In\nwhat direction? No action can be taken in period t = 0 - think of period t = 0 as a very busy day.\nSolution: Without the snowstorm, Bob did the pset in period 4 and got -40 utils. In period-0\nutility, that is -10 utils. With the snowstorm, Bob does the pset in period 2, getting -20 utils. In\nperiod-0 utility, that is -5 utils. Hence Bob is better off. The snowstorm has only made things worse\nor unchanged each day, but because it helps Bob overcome his procrastination problems, it makes\nhim better off.\n10. (2 points) When does Carol do the pset? How is her long-term utility (from day 0) affected by the\nsnowstorm? Why?\nPage 9\n\nSolution:\nCarol will now do it at t = 2.\nCarol is a fully-sophisticated hyperbolic discounter. She has a rational expectation, i.e. she fully\nunderstands her future present bias. Taking into account her future choice, she solves her utility\nmaximization problem by backward induction.\nAt t = 4, she has no choice but to do the problem set then (since otherwise the world will end).\nDo the pset at\nt = 1\nt = 2\nt = 3\nt = 4\nU4\n-\n-\n-\n-88\nAt t = 3, she heavily discounts the future (period t = 4), so she prefers to do the pset at t = 4.\nThat is, she doesn't do it at t = 3.\nDo the pset at\nt = 1\nt = 2\nt = 3\nt = 4\nU3\n-\n-84\n-22\nAt t = 2, she heavily discounts the future, i.e. periods t = 3 and t = 4. If she could be sure that\nshe'd actually do the pset at t = 3, she would prefer to wait until then. However, she anticipates\nher choice at t = 3 (which is to wait until t = 4) correctly, such that, effectively, at t = 2 she chooses\nbetween doing the pset at t = 2 or at t = 4. Waiting until t = 4 is worse from her point of view,\nthus she does the pset at t = 2.\nDo the pset at\nt = 1\nt = 2\nt = 3\nt = 4\nU2\n-\n-20\n-21\n-22\nAnticipating her future choices, at t = 1, she effectively chooses between doing the pset at t = 1 or\nat t = 2, so she decides to wait until t = 2.\nDo the pset at\nt = 1\nt = 2\nt = 3\nt = 4\nU1\n-9\n-5\n-21\n-22\nThe snowstorm makes Carol delay her effort! Procrastinating until Day 2 is now credible because of\nthe threat of the snowstorm. This snowstorm actually makes her worse off even though she won't be\ndirectly affected by it (she won't be working on days 3 and 4), because it has enabled some amount\nof procrastination. With no snowstorm (or the longer one), she was getting -2.25 Day-0 utils. With\nthis shorter snowstorm, she gets -5 Day-0 utils.\nNow suppose that a Californian tech startup, SnowBiz, can trigger or prevent a snowstorm for a fee.\n11. (2 points) On day 0, SnowBiz goes and asks Bob whether he wants to pay them to create the snowstorm\ndescribed in question 8. Is Bob willing to pay anything for this snowstorm? What could SnowBiz do to\nincrease his willingness to pay?\nSolution: Bob is unaware of his procrastination problem and thinks he will do the pset in pe\nriod 1. Therefore he does not value the snowstorm at all. SnowBiz could inform him about his\nprocrastination problem.\nPage 10\n\n12. (2 points) On day 0, SnowBiz goes and asks Carol whether she wants to pay them to prevent the\nsnowstorm. How much is Carol willing to pay? Assume that 1 util in day 0 is worth 1 dollar.\nSolution: Carol, on day 0, does not like this snowstorm: she knows it would make her procrastinate\nthe pset until day 2. She is willing to pay 2.75 dollars to avoid it.\n13. (2 points) Why are things so different for Carol and Bob? Think of the snowstorm as a commitment\ndevice. Why is it the case that it helps Bob but it hurts Carol? What is the lesson here about commitment\ndevices?\nSolution: Bob is naive. His naivet e leads him to procrastinate the pset until the last minute, absent\nthe snowstorm. The snowstorm helps as a commitment device: by making the pset much worse in\ndays 3 and 4, it makes Bob put in the effort on day 2.\nCarol is sophisticated. Anticipating future procrastination, she does the pset on Day 1 if there is no\nsnowstorm. But the snowstorm hurts her Day-0 self, since it makes Carol procrastinate until Day\n2. Day 1-Carol knows that, with the snowstorm, she will have no choice but to do the pset on Day\n2, and Day 1-Carol is happy with this small delay, which however her long-term self (her in period\n0) does not like.\nThe lesson here is that commitment devices can help or hurt depending on the degree of sophisti\ncation. They can hurt when they credibly prevent procrastination in the medium term, which may\nallow procrastination in the short term.\nPage 11\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n14.13 Psychology and Economics\nSpring 2021\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Answers without adequate explanation will not receive full\ncredit.\nQuestion: Payday Lending\nCalvin is a fully naive hyperbolic discounter with = 0.5 and δ = 1 and ˆ = 1. Hobbes is a fully sophisticated\nhyperbolic discounter with = 0.5 and δ = 1 and ˆ = = 0.5. They lives for three periods: t = 0, 1, and 2. They\nderive utility from consumption in each period. They have the same instantaneous CRRA utility from consuming\nan amount ct ≥ 0 (i.e. ct < 0 is not possible) in period t :\np\nu(ct) =\nct for t = 0, 1, 2\nAccordingly, their discounted lifetime utility from the perspective of period t = 0, 1 is given by\np\nPs=2\np\nUt(c0, c1, c2) =\nct +\ncs\ns=t+1\nand their discounted lifetime utility at t = 2 is simply pc2.\nWe also defne their long-term lifetime utility as\np\np\np\nW(c0, c1, c2) =\nc0 +\nc1 +\nc2\nwhich for instance captures their discounted lifetime utility from a period preceding 0, without distortion from present\nbias.\nCalvin and Hobbes start with wealth of e0 = $1500 at t = 0. They can keep their wealth in a checking account,\nwhich has no interest and would allow them to withdraw money at any time. That is, if they put $x into their\naccount in period 0, they could withdraw up to $x at period 1. Similarly, if they put $x into their account in period\n1, they could withdraw up to $x at period 2.\nThey receive a paycheck of y = $1200 at t = 2, which is known and perfectly anticipated by both of them at all\ntimes.\nFinally, they have access to a payday lending service: they can borrow up to $600 in period 1, but they have to\nrepay twice the borrowed amount on their payday in period 2 (i.e., they can borrow with an interest rate of 100%\nbetween these two periods).\n1. Let's frst consider a third fctional character, Susie, who is not present biased, and does not discount the\ns=2 p\nfuture. Her utility at any period t = 0, 1, 2 is P\ncs Susie also starts with $1500 at t = 0, has access to\ns=t\nthe checking account, and anticipates receiving $1200 in period 2, but has no access to payday lending. Derive\nSusie's consumption in period 0, 1 and 2. In particular, show that Susie does not use the checking account from\nperiod 1 to period 2.\n2. Explain (with no formal derivation) why this means that neither Calvin nor Hobbes would use the checking\naccount from period 1 to period 2.\nGiven this result, we will now work under the (non-binding) assumption that the checking account is only\navailable from period 0 to period 1, for simplicity.\n\n3. Let e1 ≥ 0 denote the amount of money in Calvin's (or Hobbes') checking account when he enters period 1.\nAssume e1 ≤ y. Derive the amount that he decides to borrow from the payday lending service, b, as a function\nof e1. Show that he will consume an equal amount in periods 1 and 2, i.e. c1 = c2.\n4. Using the result from the previous question, derive the amount of money e\nthat Hobbes, who is fully sophisti-\nS\ncated, decides to put in his checking account in period 0. Hint: Do not worry about checking corner solutions, i.e.\nassume that eS ≤ y in order to use the answer to the previous question, and just verify that the value obtained\nindeed verifes this inequality.\n5. How much will Hobbes end up borrowing from the payday lending service and consuming in each period?\n6. Now, let's consider Calvin, who is fully naive (\nˆ = 1). In period 0, how much does Calvin predict he will borrow\nfrom the payday lending service in period 1 if he were to leave e1 in his checking account?\n7. Derive the amount e\nthat Calvin decides to leave in his checking account in period 0. Hint: Do not worry\nN\nabout checking corner solutions, i.e. assume that 4eN ≤ y in order to use the answer to the previous question,\nand just verify that the value obtained indeed verifes this inequality.\n8. How much will Calvin end up borrowing from the payday lending service and consuming in each period?\n9. Discuss how Calvin's and Hobbes' consumption paths di er. Compute their long-term lifetime utilities, compare\nthem, and discuss intuitively why they are ordered in this way.\n10. Now, assume that no payday lending service is available. Derive the amounts left in the checking account in\nperiod 0 by Calvin and Hobbes.\n11. Derive the full consumption paths of Calvin and Hobbes in the absence of payday lending. Compare their\nlong-term lifetime utilities to the values found in question 9. Discuss this comparison.\n12. Suppose that in period 0, a referendum is organized to ask Calvin and Hobbes whether they want the government\nto implement a policy that shuts down payday lending. The policy would require some administrative costs which\nwould result in a tax of $1 levied at the end of period 1. The two options to vote for are Yes and No. What\nwould Calvin vote? What would Hobbes vote? (assuming they are both selfsh and only care about improving\ntheir own utility). Discuss what this example suggests for the real world problem of regulating payday lending.\nFor the rest of the problem, we consider a world where a shock just hurt Calvin and Hobbes before the time\nanalyzed in the problem, so that their initial wealth is now e0 = $200. Note that the conclusions from question\n2 also apply here so it's still correct to simply assume that there is no checking account from period 1 to period\n2.\n13. Noting that answers to questions 3 and 6 are unchanged, show that neither Calvin nor Hobbes leave anything\nin their checking accounts in period 0.\n14. Compute Calvin and Hobbes' resulting consumption path.\n15. As in question 10, derive the amounts left in the checking accounts in period 0 by Calvin and Hobbes if no\npayday lending service is available. Derive the resulting consumption paths.\n16. Compare the long-term lifetime utilities of Calvin and Hobbes with and without access to the payday lending\nservice now that their initial wealth e0 is lower. Why is this comparison yielding a di erent conclusion than in\nquestion 11?\nPage 2\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n14.13 Psychology and Economics\nSpring 2021\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Similarly, if they put $x into their account in period\n1, they could withdraw up to $x at period 2.\nThey receive a paycheck of y = $1200 at t = 2, which is known and perfectly anticipated by both of them at all\ntimes.\nFinally, they have access to a payday lending service: they can borrow up to $600 in period 1, but they have to\nrepay twice the borrowed amount on their payday in period 2 (i.e., they can borrow with an interest rate of 100%\nbetween these two periods).\n1. Let's frst consider a third fctional character, Susie, who is not present biased, and does not discount the\nP\np\nfuture. Her utility at any period t = 0, 1, 2 is\ns=2\ncs Susie also starts with $1500 at t = 0, has access to\ns=t\nthe checking account, and anticipates receiving $1200 in period 2, but has no access to payday lending. Derive\nSusie's consumption in period 0, 1 and 2. In particular, show that Susie does not use the checking account from\nperiod 1 to period 2.\n\nSolution: Susie's consumption path is c0 = c1 = 750, c2 = 1200.\nSusie is fully patient: she puts equal weight on each period. Her instantaneous utility is strictly concave.\nThus, she wants to smooth consumption as much as possible. Ideally, she would consume a third of her\nlifetime income at each period. But she cannot consume less than $1200 in period 2 since she has no access\nto credit. $1200 is more than a third of her lifetime income ($2700) therefore she will consume exactly $1200\nin period 2 and not use the checking account between period 1 and 2. She will spread the remaining lifetime\nwealth ($1500) equally between period 0 and 1 using the checking account.\n2. Explain (with no formal derivation) why this means that neither Calvin nor Hobbes would use the checking\naccount from period 1 to period 2.\nSolution: Calvin and Hobbes have preferences which add present bias on top of Susie's preferences. Given\nthat Susie does not use her checking account from period 1 to period 2, Calvin and Hobbes would not either.\nThis intuition is derived formally below, where we fnd non-negative amounts borrowed from the payday\nlending.\nGiven this result, we will now work under the (non-binding) assumption that the checking account is only\navailable from period 0 to period 1, for simplicity.\n3.

Consumption in\nperiod 1 is equal to the amount in our character's bank account plus the amount borrowed, so c1 = e1 + b.\nConsumption in period 2 is equal to income minus twice the borrowed amount (since the payday lending\ninterest rate is 100%), so c2 = y -2b. Our character thus solves:\np\np\np\np\nmax c1 +\nc2 = max\ne1 + b +\ny -2b\nb≥0\nDi erentiating with respect to b, we get the frst-order condition:\n\np\n-\np\n= 0\n2 e1 + b\ny -2b\nPlugging in = 2 and solving for b,\n2 (2)\np\n=\np\n2 e1 + b\n2 y -2b\np\n= p\ne1 + b\ny -2b\np\np\ne1 + b =\ny -2b\ne1 + b = y -2b\nSince c1 = e1 + b and c2 = y -2b, we've just shown that c1 = c2 optimally, as desired. Continuing,\ny -3b = e1\nPage 2\n\n3b = y -e1\ny -e1\nb =\nWhich will only be valid for y ≥ e1. For higher e1, the character would not borrow anything.\ny+2e1\nAs a result, in period 1, Calvin (and Hobbes) will consume c1 = e1 + b =\n. In period 2, they will\ny+2e1\nconsume c2 = y -2b =\n= c1. This is coming from the fact that utility is discounted at rate = 2 in\nperiod 2 relative to period 1, but money can be transferred from period 2 to period 1 at the conversion rate\n1 = 1\n2 .\n1+r\nS\n4. Using the result from the previous question, derive the amount of money e1 that Hobbes, who is fully sophisti\ncated, decides to put in his checking account in period 0. Hint: Do not worry about checking corner solutions, i.e.\nS\nassume that e1 ≤ y in order to use the answer to the previous question, and just verify that the value obtained\nindeed verifes this inequality.\nSolution:\nHobbes is fully sophisticated, so in period 0, he correctly anticipates how b will depend on e1. Consumption\nin period 0 is his initial wealth minus the amount he puts in the bank account, so c0 = e0 - e1. From\ny+2e1\nquestion 3, we know that c1 = c2 =\n. Since e0 and y are fxed, his choice of e1 completely determines\nhis consumption path {c0, c1, c2}. So he solves:\nr\np\np\np\np\ny + 2e1\nmax c0 +\nc1 +\nc2 = max e0 -e1 + 2\ne1≥0\nDi erentiating with respect to e1, we get the frst-order condition:\n-\n+ 2 q\n= 0\n2pe0 -e1\ny+2e1\nPlugging in = 2 and solving for e1,\n2( 1\n2 )( 2\n3 )\n= q\n2pe0 -e1\ny+2e1\n= q\n2pe0 -e1\ny+2e1\nr\ny + 2e1\n2pe0 -e1 = 3\ny\n2e1\n\n4(e0 -e1) = 9 3 + 3\nSolving the last line for e1 gives:\n4e0 -3y\n4(1500) -3(1200)\nS\ne =\n=\n= 240\nS\nWe verify that e1 thus obtained is lower than y and yields a positive b.\n5. How much will Hobbes end up borrowing from the payday lending service and consuming in each period?\nPage 3\n\nSolution:\nUsing the results from questions 3 and 4, we obtain:\nc0 = e0 -e1 = 1260\ny -e1\n1200 -240\nb =\n=\n= 320\ny + 2e1\n1200 + 2(240)\nc1 = c2 =\n=\n= 560.\n6. Now, let's consider Calvin, who is fully naive (\nˆ = 1). In period 0, how much does Calvin predict he will borrow\nfrom the payday lending service in period 1 if he were to leave e1 in his checking account?\nSolution:\nˆ\nCalvin is fully naive, so in period 0, he predicts that he will behave in period 1 as if = beta = 1. Let's\ncall Calvin's predicted borrowing ˆb. We still have that c1 = e1 + ˆb and c2 = y -2ˆb. So he predicts that in\nperiod 1, he will solve the following problem\nq\nq\np\np\np\np\nmax c1 +\nc2 = max c1 +\nc2 = max\ne1 + ˆb +\ny -2ˆb\nˆb≥0\nDi erentiating with respect to b, we get the frst-order condition:\np\n- q\n= 0\ne1 + ˆb\ny -2ˆb\nSolving for b,\np\n=\nq\ne1 + ˆb\ny -2ˆb\np\n= q\ne1 + ˆb\ny -2ˆb\nq\nq\ny -2ˆb = 2\ne1 + ˆb\ny -2ˆb = 4(e1 + ˆb)\nRearranging, we get:\ny -4e1\nˆb =\ny-4e1\nThus Calvin predicts that he will borrow ˆb =\nif y ≥ 4e1 and 0 otherwise.\nN\n7. Derive the amount e1 that Calvin decides to leave in his checking account in period 0. Hint: Do not worry\nN\nabout checking corner solutions, i.e. assume that 4e1 ≤ y in order to use the answer to the previous question,\nand just verify that the value obtained indeed verifes this inequality.\nPage 4\n\nSolution:\nCalvin is fully naive, so he predicts that his borrowing behavior will be as found above in question 6.\nHowever, like Hobbes, in period 0, he discounts both period-1 utility and period-2 utility by . He thus\nsolves:\np\np\np\nmax c0 +\nc1 +\nc2\nq\nq\np\nmax e0 -e1 +\ne1 + ˆb +\ny -2ˆb\ne1 ≥0\ns\nr\n\np\ny -4e1\ny -4e1\nmax e0 -e1 +\ne1 +\n+\ny -2\ne1≥0\nr\nr\np\ny\ne1\n2y\n4e1\nmax e0 -e1 +\ne1≥0\n6 + 3 + 3 + 3\nr\nr\n\np\ny\ne1\ny\ne1\nmax e0 -e1 +\n3 + 4\ne1≥0\n6 +\n6 + 3\nr\nr\np\ny\ne1\ny\ne1\nmax e0 -e1 + 6 +\n+ 2 6 +\ne1 ≥0\nr\np\ny + 2e1\nmax e0 -e1 + 3\ne1≥0\nDi erentiating with respect to e1, we get the frst-order condition:\np\n-3 q\n2 e0 -e1\ny+2e1\nPlugging in = 2 and solving for e1,\n1 3( 1\n2 )( 3\n1 )\np\n=\nq\n2 e0 -e1\ny+2e1\np\n=\nq\ne0 -e1\ny+2e1\nr\ny + 2e1\np\n=\ne0 -e1\n\ny + 2e1\n= e0 -\ne1\nSolving the last line for e1 gives\n6e0 -4y\n6(1500) -4(1200)\nN\ne =\n=\n= 300\nN\nWe verify that e1 thus obtained is non greater than y/4 and yields a non-negative ˆb.\n8. How much will Calvin end up borrowing from the payday lending service and consuming in each period?\nSolution:\nIn period 0, Calvin consumes e0 - e1 = 1200. Then, Calvin surprises himself in period 1 and borrows\nPage 5\n\ny-e1\naccording to the behavior with = 2 that we derived in question 3: b =\n= 300. So while he expects\nnot to borrow,\n1200 -1200\nˆb(300) = y -4(300) =\n= 0,\nhe ends up doing so. He then consumes\ny + 2e1\n1200 + 2(300)\nc1 = c2 =\n=\n= 600.\n9. Discuss how Calvin's and Hobbes' consumption paths di er. Compute their long-term lifetime utilities, compare\nthem, and discuss intuitively why they are ordered in this way.\nSolution:\nCalvin's consumption path is: c0 = 1200, c1 = 600, and c2 = 600. Hobbes' consumption path is: c0 = 1260,\nc1 = 560, and c2 = 560.\nCalvin is naive about his future present bias and thus underestimates his propensity to borrow from the\npayday lender. Thinking that he won't borrow in period 1, Calvin thus saves more and consumes less in\nperiod 0. He then surprises himself in period 1 by borrowing from the payday lender.\nHobbes is sophisticated and realizes that he will borrow in period 1. Since this borrowing will increase his\nperiod 1 consumption, Hobbes saves less and consumes more in period 0. Hobbes thus borrows less than\nCalvin in period 1.\np\np\np\nCalvin's long-term lifetime utility is\n1200 +\n600 +\n600 ˇ 83.63. Hobbes' long-term lifetime utility is\np\np\np\n1260 + 560 + 560 ˇ 82.83.\nDespite being naive, Calvin attains higher lifetime utility! Being naive has two consequences here: 1) Calvin\nborrows more in period 1 and incurs more interest costs, and 2) Calvin's consumption path is actually\nsmoother, since he saves more in period 0. The second e ect outweighs the frst. Hobbes' sophistication\nlowers his beneft of saving in period 0 (because he anticipates that borrowing in period 1 is already pushing\nup his period-1 consumption). So Hobbes saves less in period 0, and his resulting consumption path is less\nsmooth than Calvin's.\n10. Now, assume that no payday lending service is available. Derive the amounts left in the checking account in\nperiod 0 by Calvin and Hobbes.\nSolution:\nWithout payday lending service, there is only one decision, made in period 0: how much to leave in the\nchecking account. Sophistication thus does not matter here (c2 is fxed at y) and both characters solve the\nsame problem:\np\np\np\nmax e0 -e1 +\ne1 +\ny\ne1≥0\nwhich yields the frst-order condition:\n\n-\n2p\n+ 2p\n= 0\ne0 -e1\ne1\nPlugging in = 2 and solving for e1,\nPage 6\n\np\n=\np\n2 e0 -e1\n2 e1\n2p\np\ne1 =\ne0 -e1\n4e1 = e0 -e1\n5e1 = e0\ne0\ne1 =\n=\n= 300\n11. Derive the full consumption paths of Calvin and Hobbes in the absence of payday lending. Compare their\nlong-term lifetime utilities to the values found in question 9. Discuss this comparison.\nSolution:\nFrom the previous question, both characters have the same consumption path: c0 = 1200, c1 = 300 and\np\np\nc2 = 1200. This yields long-term lifetime utility of\n300 + 2\n1200 ˇ 86.60.\nIn question 9 with payday lending, we found that Calvin's lifetime utility was about 83.63 and Hobbes'\nlifetime utility was about 82.83. So both characters are helped by the elimination of payday lending. Calvin\nbenefts because he can no longer borrow and thus no longer incurs interest costs. Hobbes is helped because\nhe no longer anticipates borrowing in period 1. This raises the the beneft for Hobbes of saving in period 0\n(he no longer anticipates that c1 will be pushed up by borrowing), so he saves more in period 0 and attains\na smoother consumption path, raising his lifetime utility.\n12. Suppose that in period 0, a referendum is organized to ask Calvin and Hobbes whether they want the government\nto implement a policy that shuts down payday lending. The policy would require some administrative costs which\nwould result in a tax of $1 levied at the end of period 1. The two options to vote for are Yes and No. What\nwould Calvin vote? What would Hobbes vote? (assuming they are both selfsh and only care about improving\ntheir own utility). Discuss what this example suggests for the real world problem of regulating payday lending.\nSolution:\nCalvin would be helped by the removal of payday lending, but he fails to realize this since he plans not to\nborrow anything. He would thus vote No since the policy would bring him nothing and cost him a dollar of\ntax. Hobbes would also beneft from payday lending, and since he is sophisticated he actually foresees this\nbeneft in period 0. The increase in Hobbes' lifetime utility resulting from the elimination of payday lending\nis much larger than the utility cost of paying $1 in period 1. Hobbes would thus vote Yes. This example\nillustrates that regulating payday lending may be diycult, since not all people who would beneft from such\nregulation are actually aware of the benefts.\nFor the rest of the problem, we consider a world where a shock just hurt Calvin and Hobbes before the time\nanalyzed in the problem, so that their initial wealth is now e0 = $200. Note that the conclusions from question\n2 also apply here so it's still correct to simply assume that there is no checking account from period 1 to period\n2.\n13. Noting that answers to questions 3 and 6 are unchanged, show that neither Calvin nor Hobbes leave anything\nin their checking accounts in period 0.\nPage 7\n\nSolution:\nThe objectives in questions 4 and 7 remain the same. Using the formulas we found expressing e1 as a function\nof e0 and y, we obtain:\n4e0 -3y\nS\ne =\n= -280\n6e0 -4y\nN\ne\nˇ -257\nSince saving must be non-negative, the period-0 optimization problems are now solved at the corner solution\ne1 = 0 for both Calvin and Hobbes.\n14. Compute Calvin and Hobbes' resulting consumption path.\nSolution:\nWith e1 = 0 for both characters, and with the logic from question 3 still mandating that c1 = c2, we obtain\nthe consumption path\nc0 = e0 = 200\ny + 2e1\ny + 0\nc1 = c2 =\n=\n=\n= 400\nfor both characters.\n15. As in question 10, derive the amounts left in the checking accounts in period 0 by Calvin and Hobbes if no\npayday lending service is available. Derive the resulting consumption paths.\nSolution:\nIf there is no payday lending, as in question 10, e1\nc0 = e0 -40 = 160, c1 = 40, c2 = y = 1200.\n= e0\n5 = 40. This results in the consumption path\n16. Compare the long-term lifetime utilities of Calvin and Hobbes with and without access to the payday lending\nservice now that their initial wealth e0 is lower. Why is this comparison yielding a di erent conclusion than in\nquestion 11?\nSolution:\np\np\nWith access to the payday lending, both characters attain long-term lifetime utility of 200+2\n400 ˇ 54.14.\np\np\np\nWithout payday lending, they both attain long-term lifetime utility of\n160 + 40 + 1200 ˇ 53.61. Thus\nboth characters are now harmed by the elimination of payday lending, whereas both were helped in question\n11.\nWith a negative shock to initial wealth, there is a very large return from the ability to smooth consumption\nby borrowing against period 2, even at the very high payday lending rate. The inability to borrow against\nperiod 2 when e0 is low thus causes the elimination of payday lending to harm both characters. Since\nHobbes wasn't planning to borrow in period 1 anyway, the elimination of payday lending doesn't provide\nany consumption-smoothing benefts (whereas it did provide such benefts in question 11).\nPage 8\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n14.13 Psychology and Economics\nSpring 2021\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

We're lucky to be studying social preferences during MIT's Random Acts of Kindness Week. The idea of a\nrandom act of kindness is to perform a selfless act to either help or cheer up a random other person (possibly\na stranger), for no reason other than making that person happier. To better understand how random acts of\nkindness might a\nect you and others, please do the following (in this order!):\n(a) Pick a random act of kindness (RAK) and a person to whom you might want to perform it. Such random\nacts might include a wide range of actions, including\n(i) sending an encouraging note;\n(ii) expressing your appreciation; or\n(iii) expressing your gratitude to a friend, colleague, former teacher, or family member.\nTry to put some thought into your RAK and try to come up with something that you think could make the\nother person's day. To address any concerns about the coronavirus, try to avoid random acts that require\nphysical contact.\n(b) Predict, on a scale from -5 to 5, how good you would feel after performing a random act of kindness for\nsomeone. On this scale, let -5 correspond to feeling much worse than normal, 0 correspond to feeling no\ndi\nerent than normal, and 5 correspond to feeling much better than normal.\n(c) Predict, on a scale from -5 to 5, how the other person will react.

Answers without adequate explanation will not receive full\ncredit.\nPart 1: Social Preferences and Workplace Incentive Schemes (40 points)\nIn lecture, we discussed the evidence from Bandiera et al. (2005), which studies the e ect of relative pay on worker\nproductivity. In this question, we will consider workers' e ort choices for di erent payment schemes.\nSuppose worker i can choose how many kilograms of berries to pick each day (qi). Picking more berries requires\nmore strenuous physical exertion and the disutility of this exertion is c(qi) = qi\n2. The worker works on a feld with\nN -1 other workers (so a total of N workers work on the feld). Assume that each worker independently chooses\nhow many kilograms of berries to pick (i.e., the workers do not coordinate or collude).\n1. (4 points) First, assume that workers' utility only depends on their own income and their disutility of e ort. In\nparticular, the utility of worker i with income yi and who picks qi kilograms of berries is\nui(yi, qi) = yi -c(qi).\nSuppose that workers are paid a piece rate of $p per kilogram picked. Thus yi = pqi.\nP ∗\nHow many kilograms of berries should worker i pick under piece rates q\n?\ni\n2.

(4 points) Now assume that workers' utility exhibits a simple form of altruism; in particular, the utility of a\nworker i is\nX\nUi(yi, qi, y-i, q-i) = ui(yi, qi) +\nuj(yj, qj),\nj6=i\nwhere > 0 and ui(yi, qi) = yi -c(qi) (as above).\nP A∗\nHow many kilograms of berries should worker i pick under piece rates and this simple form of altruism q\n?\nHow does simple altruism a ect productivity when piece rates are used?\n5.

(4 points) What is the di erence in the aggregate quantity of kilograms picked under piece rates and relative\npay when workers have simple altruism?\n8. (4 points) Suppose that the summer holidays begin and a lot of worker i's friends join the farm (assume the\ntotal number of workers is still N). In our framework, this can be modeled as increasing the parameter from\nto = 2 . How might this a ect the how many kilograms of berries worker i picks under the two di erent\npayment schemes from above (piece rates and relative pay)?\n9. (4 points) Suppose that the farm uses relative pay and that the other workers will punish worker i by reducing\nher utility by D if she picks too much. You can think of these punishments as a tool that workers use in order\nto force each other to reduce output (a type of collusion). Instead of simple altruism, assume that worker i's\nutility is\n(\nyi -c(qi)\nif qi ≤ (p - )/2\nui(yi, qi) =\nyi -c(qi) -D if qi > (p - )/2.\nAssume worker i's choice of how many kilograms to pick does not a ect her coworkers quantities qj for j 6= i.\n\nAlso assume that D >\n2 .\nRS∗\nHow many kilograms of berries should worker i to pick under relative pay with social enforcement q\n?\ni\nHow does the solution compare to question 5?\nCan we distinguish between altruism or collusion simply by looking at worker i's choice of how many berries to\npick?\n10. (4 points) What evidence do Bandiera et al. (2005) use to distinguish between pure altruism and collusion?\nExplain.\nPart 2: Alternative Theories of Social Preferences (40 points)\nIn class, we played many variants of games that economists use to analyze social preferences. In this question, we\nconsider a general utility function that can accommodate many di erent theories of social preferences. Suppose\nthat Alex (player 1) and Aaron (player 2) play a two-person game with payo s x1 (for Alex) and x2 (for Aaron).\nFor concreteness, think of the games that were played in class during lecture on March 4th. Aaron is the second\nplayer in the game (so, for example, he may have the option to accept or reject an o er made by Alex). Aaron's\nutility over outcome of the game is\n(\nˆx1 + (1 -ˆ)x2\nif x2 ≥ x1\nu2(x1, x2) =\n,\nx1 + (1 - )x2\nif x2 < x1\nwhere , ˆ 2 R.\n1. (8 points) Describe Aaron's utility function. Why might ˆ and be di erent? Do you think that it is more\nnatural for ˆ to be larger than or not? Why?\n2. (8 points) For each of the following cases, describe how Aaron's utility depends on his own payo and Alex's\npayo . You might want to consult Charness and Rabin (2002) while you try to answer this question.\n(i) ≤ ˆ < 0\n(ii) < 0 < ˆ < 1 (also comment on why we require and ˆ to be less than 1)\n(iii) 0 < ≤ ˆ ≤ 1\n(iv) = ˆ = 0\nPage 2\n\n3.

      "content": "MIT 14.13 - Problem Set 4\nPlease make sure to explain your answers carefully and concisely, i.e. do not simply write a numeric answer\nwithout an explanation of how you arrived at this answer. Answers without adequate explanation will not receive full\ncredit.\nPart 1: Social Preferences and Workplace Incentive Schemes (40 points)\nIn lecture, we discussed the evidence from Bandiera et al. (2005), which studies the e ect of relative pay on worker\nproductivity. In this question, we will consider workers' e ort choices for di erent payment schemes.\nSuppose worker i can choose how many kilograms of berries to pick each day (qi). Picking more berries requires\nmore strenuous physical exertion and the disutility of this exertion is c(qi) = qi\n2. The worker works on a feld with\nN -1 other workers (so a total of N workers work on the feld). Assume that each worker independently chooses\nhow many kilograms of berries to pick (i.e., the workers do not coordinate or collude).\n1. (4 points) First, assume that workers' utility only depends on their own income and their disutility of e ort. In\nparticular, the utility of worker i with income yi and who picks qi kilograms of berries is\nui(yi, qi) = yi -c(qi).\nSuppose that workers are paid a piece rate of $p per kilogram picked. Thus yi = pqi.\nP ∗\nHow many kilograms of berries should worker i pick under piece rates q\n?\ni\nSolution:\nThe utility of worker i can be written in terms of qi; it is\nui(qi) = pqi -q\n2 .\ni\nThe frst-order condition w.r.t qi is\nP ∗\np -2q = 0,\ni\nP ∗\nwhich implies that q\n= p/2.\ni\n2. (4 points) Now suppose that workers receive relative pay; if worker i picks qi kilograms and the other workers\npick qj kilograms, for j 6= i, then worker i is paid\nX qj\nyi = pqi -\nN -1.\nj6=i\nAssume that > 0, so that if other workers pick a lot, then worker i gets paid less.\nR∗\nHow many kilograms of berries should worker i pick under relative pay q\n?\ni\n\nSolution:\nSince worker i does not care about other workers, and she cannot choose the number of kilograms that other\nP ∗\nR∗\nworkers pick, her frst-order condition is the same and thus q\n= q\n= p/2\ni\ni\n3. (4 points) Compare your answers to the previous questions. Do you fnd that workers exert the same or di erent\ne ort under the two payment schemes? Explain\nSolution:\nSame answers in 1 and 2. Since workers only care about their own e ort and pay, they do not care about\nthe impact of their own e ort on others' pay.\n4. (4 points) Now assume that workers' utility exhibits a simple form of altruism; in particular, the utility of a\nworker i is\nX\nUi(yi, qi, y-i, q-i) = ui(yi, qi) +\nuj(yj, qj),\nj6=i\nwhere > 0 and ui(yi, qi) = yi -c(qi) (as above).\nP A∗\nHow many kilograms of berries should worker i pick under piece rates and this simple form of altruism q\n?\ni\nHow does simple altruism a ect productivity when piece rates are used?\nSolution:\nSubstituting everything into the utility function gives\nX\n\nUi(yi, qi, y-i, q-i) = pqi -q\n2 +\npqj -q\ni\nj\nj6=i\nOnce again, the frst-order condition w.r.t qi is\nP A∗\np -2q\n= 0,\ni\nP A∗\nand so q\n= p/2. Thus, this form of simple altruism has no e ect on productivity when piece rates are\ni\nused.\n5. (4 points) How many kilograms of berries should worker i to pick under relative pay and this simple form of\nRA∗\naltruism q\n?\ni\nSolution:\nSubstituting everything into the utility function gives\nX\nX\nX\nqj\nqk\nUi(yi, qi, y-i, q-i) = pqi -\n-q\n2 +\n4pqj -\n-q\nN -1\ni\nN -1\nj\nj6\nj=i\n=i\nk=j\nThe frst-order condition w.r.t qi is\nRA∗\np -2q\n- = 0,\ni\nwhich implies\nRA∗\nq\n= (p - )/2 < p/2.\ni\nPage 2\n\n6. (4 points) Compare your answers:\n(i) Compare your answers to questions 4 and 5. Do you fnd di erent answers? Why?\n(ii) Compare your answers to questions 1 and 4. Do you fnd di erent answers? Why?\n(iii) Compare your answers to questions 2 and 5. Do you fnd di erent answers? Why?\nSolution:\n(i) The answers to 4 and 5 are di erent. In both cases worker i's is altruistic. She picks more under piece\nrates (question 4) than under relative pay (question 5). The reason that she picks less under relative\npay is because she is altruistic and she takes into account the fact that with relative pay when she\npicks less she lowers her coworkers pay, which hurts them, and she does not want to do that.\n(ii) The answers to 1 and 4 are the same. In both cases, the farm uses piece rates. In question 1 the\nworker is not altruistic, while in question 4 she is altruistic. However, under piece rates, the quantity\nof berries that she picks has no e ect on her coworkers and so being altruistic has no e ect.\n(iii) The answers to 2 and 5 are di erent. In both cases, the farm uses relative pay. In question 2, the\nworker is not altruistic, while in question 5 she is altruistic. In question 2, she picks more than in\nquestion 5. The reason for this is because in question 2, she does not mind lowering her coworkers pay\nby working more because she is not altruistic. In contrast, in question 5, she works less because she\ndoes not want to lower her coworkers pay because she is altruistic.\n7. (4 points) What is the di erence in the aggregate quantity of kilograms picked under piece rates and relative\npay when workers have simple altruism?\nSolution: Under piece rates, the aggregate quantity picked is Np/2.\nUnder relative rates, the aggregate quantity picked is N(p - )N/2.\nThe di erence is N/2. More berries are picked under piece rates.\n8. (4 points) Suppose that the summer holidays begin and a lot of worker i's friends join the farm (assume the\ntotal number of workers is still N). In our framework, this can be modeled as increasing the parameter from\nto = 2 . How might this a ect the how many kilograms of berries worker i picks under the two di erent\npayment schemes from above (piece rates and relative pay)?\nSolution: Under piece rates, altruism has no e ect and worker i will still choose p/2.\nUnder relative rates, worker i will pick even fewer kilograms of berries than in question 5: specifcally\nRA∗\n(p -2 )/2 < (p - )/2 = q\ni\nwhere the inequality holds because > 0.\n9. (4 points) Suppose that the farm uses relative pay and that the other workers will punish worker i by reducing\nher utility by D if she picks too much. You can think of these punishments as a tool that workers use in order\nto force each other to reduce output (a type of collusion). Instead of simple altruism, assume that worker i's\nutility is\n(\nyi -c(qi)\nif qi ≤ (p - )/2\nui(yi, qi) =\nyi -c(qi) -D if qi > (p - )/2.\nAssume worker i's choice of how many kilograms to pick does not a ect her coworkers quantities qj for j = i.\n\nAlso assume that D >\n2 .\nPage 3\n\nRS∗\nHow many kilograms of berries should worker i to pick under relative pay with social enforcement q\n?\ni\nHow does the solution compare to question 5?\nCan we distinguish between altruism or collusion simply by looking at worker i's choice of how many berries to\npick?\nRS∗\nSolution: To solve for the utility maximizing q\n, solve for the optimal quantity for qi ≤ (p - )/2 and\ni\nqi > (p - )/2 and compare the maximized utilities.\nFirst, substitute terms to get:\n(\nP\nqj\npqi -\nN-1 -q\nif qi ≤ (p - )/2\nj6\ni\n=i\nui(yi, qi) =\nP\npqi -\nqj\n2 -D if qi > (p - )/2.\nj6\nN-1 -q\n=i\ni\nNotice that both cases are quadratic functions of qi.\nIf qi > (p - )/2, then the frst-order condition is the same as question 2(ii) because D does not depend\non qi. Thus the solution is ˆqi = p/2, which yields utility\np2\nX qj\nu\nˆ =\n-\n-D.\nN -1\nj6=i\nIf qi ≤ (p - )/2, then because the objective is a quadratic with a maximum at p/2, we know that the\nsolution is to choose the largest quantity possible in the region. Thus the solution is qi = (p - )/2, which\nyields utility\nX\np(p - )\nqj\n(p - )2\nu\n=\n-\n-\n.\nN -1\nj6=i\nExpanding and simplifying yields\np2\nX qj\n2 2\nu\n=\n-\n- 4 .\nN -1\nj6=i\n\nSince we assumed that D >\n2 , we see that u > u\nˆ and thus worker i chooses\nRS∗\nq\n= (p - )/2.\ni\nThe solution is exactly the same as in question 5. As a consequence, we cannot distinguish between altruism\nor collusion if we only look at worker i's choice of how many berries to pick.\n10. (4 points) What evidence do Bandiera et al. (2005) use to distinguish between pure altruism and collusion?\nExplain.\nSolution: Bandiera et al. (2005) use data from fruit with tall bushes where coworkers' e ort (and output)\nare unobserved and short bushes where coworkers' e ort is observed. The inability to observe coworkers'\noutput has no e ect if choices are driven by altruism. However if choices are a ected by a desire to avoid\npunishment (in the collusion case), then the inability to observe coworkers' output has real e ects on worker\nproductivity. Bandiera et al. (2005) fnd that relative pay only has e ects when output can be monitored,\nwhich provides evidence in favor of the collusion explanation.\nPage 4\n\nPart 2: Alternative Theories of Social Preferences (40 points)\nIn class, we played many variants of games that economists use to analyze social preferences. In this question, we\nconsider a general utility function that can accommodate many di erent theories of social preferences. Suppose\nthat Alex (player 1) and Aaron (player 2) play a two-person game with payo s x1 (for Alex) and x2 (for Aaron).\nFor concreteness, think of the games that were played in class during lecture on March 4th. Aaron is the second\nplayer in the game (so, for example, he may have the option to accept or reject an o er made by Alex). Aaron's\nutility over outcome of the game is\n(\nˆx1 + (1 -ˆ)x2\nif x2 ≥ x1\nu2(x1, x2) =\n,\nx1 + (1 - )x2\nif x2 < x1\nwhere , ˆ 2 R.\n1. (8 points) Describe Aaron's utility function. Why might ˆ and be di erent? Do you think that it is more\nnatural for ˆ to be larger than or not? Why?\nSolution:\n- Aaron's utility function is a linear combination of both his own and Alex's payo s where ˆ is the weight\non Alex's payo when Aaron gets more than Alex and is the weight on Alex's payo when Alex gets\nmore than Aaron.\n- There might be a di erence between ˆ and if Aaron cares more or less about Alex's payo when he\ngets more or less than Alex. A natural assumption might be that ˆ is larger than , which means that\nAaron cares more about Alex's payo when he gets more than him. This might be natural because it\nrepresents a case where we are more generous to people who get less.\n2. (8 points) For each of the following cases, describe how Aaron's utility depends on his own payo and Alex's\npayo . You might want to consult Charness and Rabin (2002) while you try to answer this question.\n(i) ≤ ˆ < 0\n(ii) < 0 < ˆ < 1 (also comment on why we require and ˆ to be less than 1)\n(iii) 0 < ≤ ˆ ≤ 1\n(iv) = ˆ = 0\nSolution: These special cases are discussed in Charness and Rabin (2002) and have the following interpre\ntations:\n(i) ≤ ˆ ≤ 0: simple competitive preferences. Since both weights are negative, Aaron's utility is de\ncreasing in Alex's payo . When Alex gets more than Aaron, Aaron's utility decreases more rapidly in\nAlex's payo (because ≤ ˆ).\n(ii) < 0 < ˆ < 1: di erence aversion. When Alex gets more than Aaron, Aaron's utility is decreasing in\nAlex's payo (because < 0), which would reduce the di erence in their payo s. In contrast, when\nAaron gets more than Alex, Aaron's utility is increasing in Alex's payo (because ˆ > 0), which also\nreduces the di erence in their payo s. We require and ˆ to be less than 1 because otherwise, Aaron's\nutility is decreasing in his own payo .\n(iii) 1 ≥ ˆ ≥ > 0: Charness and Rabin (2002) call these \"social-welfare preferences\". Aaron's utility is\nincreasing in both his own payo and Alex's payo . When Aaron gets more than Alex he cares more\nabout Alex's payo (because ≤ ˆ).\n(iv) = ˆ = 0: simple self interest because for any payo s u2(x1, x2) = x2.\nPage 5\n\n3. (8 points) This question maintains the assumption that Aaron's utility is given by u2 and considers what we\ncan learn about the values of ˆ and using games similar to those that were played in class during lecture on\nMarch 4th. Denote payo s (x1, x2) where Alex gets x1 and Aaron gets x2. For each of the following games,\nstate whether the given choice is consistent with each of the special cases (i) - (iv) above.\n(i) A version of a dictator game where Aaron chooses L = ($4.00, $4.00) instead of R = ($7.50, $4.00).\n(ii) A version of a dictator game where Aaron chooses L = ($2.50, $3.50) instead of R = ($4.00, $4.00).\nIn both games, Alex does not have a choice of what to do and he will always accept the amount that is o ered\nto him.\nSolution:\n(i) Note that under both L and R, Aaron gets the same payo (x2 = $4.00).\n- Choosing L is consistent with (i) because under (i) Aaron's utility is decreasing in x1 and L has\na lower x1 than R.\n- Choosing L is consistent with (ii) because in both cases Alex gets (weakly) more and under (ii)\nAaron's utility is decreasing in x1 when Alex gets more.\n- Choosing L is inconsistent with (iii) because under (iii) Aaron's utility increases in Alex's payo .\n- Last, choosing L is consistent with (iv), because under (iv) Aaron only cares about his own payo ,\nwhich is equal for both choices.\n(ii) In this game, Aaron can reduce Alex's payo by $1.50, but at a cost of $0.50.\n- Choosing L is consistent with (i) because under (i) Aaron's utility is decreasing in Alex's payo\nand thus it is possible that he would pay $0.50 to reduce Alex's payo by $1.50.\n- Choosing L is inconsistent with (ii) because Aaron gets (weakly) more under either option and if\nAaron gets more, then his utility is increasing in both his own and Alex's payo , so he would not\nchoose an option that reduces both payo s.\n- Choosing L is inconsistent with (iii) because under (iii) Aaron's utility is increasing in both\npayo s.\n- Last, choosing L is inconsistent with (iv) because under (iv) Aaron maximizes x2, which involves\nchoosing R.\n4. (8 points) Consider an ultimatum game: Alex is given $10 and o ers $x to Aaron; Aaron can accept $x (and\nthen Alex gets $10 - $x) or reject $x (and then Alex and Aaron both get nothing). Suppose Alex has utility\n(\n\nˆ)x2\nif x2 ≥ x1\nˆx1 + (1 -\nu1(x1, x2) =\n.\n\n)x2\nif x2 < x1\nx1 + (1 -\nWhat is one reason why it is diycult to learn anything about ˆ or from Alex's choice of $x?\nSolution:\nIt is diycult to learn about ˆ and because Alex's choice of $x also depends on his beliefs about whether\nAaron will accept or reject the o er. For instance, if Alex thinks that Aaron will only accept o ers of x ≥ $5,\nthen he might give Alex $5 even if he is entirely selfsh and does not care about Aaron's payo and/or utility.\n5. (8 points) Suppose Aaron has social preferences with 0 < ˆ = < 1, but his utility is not linear in payo s.\nSpecifcally his utility is\n(\nˆf(x1) + (1 -ˆ)g(x2)\nif x2 ≥ x1\nu 2(x1, x2) =\n,\nf(x1) + (1 - )g(x2) if x2 < x1\nPage 6\n\nAaron likes chocolate, so his utility from chocolate is g(x2) = x2. He also knows that Alex's is lactose-intolerant;\nAlex does not eat chocolate, so f(x1) = 0.\nSuppose Alex and Aaron play a dictator game and Aaron is the dictator. He has 10 chocolates and he can give\nas many as he likes to Alex. Alex has no choices in this game. What will Aaron choose if his utility function\nis u2? If we instead assumed Aaron's utility function was u2 (from the beginning o the question), what will we\nincorrectly infer about his social preferences (because we don't know about Alex's lactose intolerance)?\nSolution: Aaron is the dictator and he knows Alex is lactose intolerant. With utility function u2 Aaron\nincorporates Alex's lactose intolerance into his utility function (f(x1) = 0). Aaron also has 0 < = ˆ < 1,\nso his utility is increasing in his own payo . Thus Aaron keeps all the chocolate for himself.\nSuppose that we assumed that Aaron had utility function u2. We see that Aaron chooses x1 = 0 and x2 = 10.\nSince x2 > x1, we can make inferences on , but not ˆ. Because of the linear utility function, all we can\ninfer is that < 1/2, however, this is not necessarily true (there is nothing in the question to exclude the\npossibility that ≥ 1/2).\nPage 7\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n14.13 Psychology and Economics\nSpring 2021\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Answers without adequate explanation will not receive full credit.\nPart 1: Climate change denial (40 points)\nClimate change arrives tomorrow. It will either be very bad (event A) or very, very, very, very, very, very bad (not\nA). Today, it is common knowledge that climate change will only be \"very bad\" with probability p 2 [0, 1].\nCharles is the President of France. Elections are the day after tomorrow. Charles discounts with a constant daily\nfactor δ 2 (0, 1) and his utility depends only on his re-election. If he is re-elected, Charles obtains utility of -4 (it is hard\nwork to be president!). If he loses the election, Charles obtains -8.\nHis Facebook advertising team has used sophisticated machine learning techniques to determine that he will be re-\nelected if climate change is very bad, but not if climate change is very, very, very, very, very, very bad (his key constituents\nare located in coastal regions).\n1. (5 points) What is Charles's expected utility today?\n2. (12 points) Charles always tells the truth. He knows he will get questions today in the presidential debate about his\nview on the probability p of very bad climate change. These questions a ect his utility today, which is now given in\nexpectation by\nf(p) + δ2E[u(election result)].\nIn particular, he knows that if climate change seems likely to be very, very, very, very, very, very bad, Charles will\nget a lot of touch questions about his current government's response. So f(p) is increasing in p.\nMIT climate researchers in Building 54 have discovered whether climate change will be very bad or very, very, very,\nvery, very, very bad. Their Nature paper is embargoed until tomorrow, but Charles can email them this morning to\nfnd out the results of their discovery.\nSuppose f(p) = ln(1 + p). Will Charles email the MIT researchers? Does this depend on δ? Does this depend on\nCharles's payo s from re-election?\n3. (5 points) Now suppose instead f(p) = (1 + p)2. Will Charles email the MIT researchers? Does this depend on δ?\nDoes this depend on Charles's payo s from re-election?\n4. (5 points) Now suppose Charles can lie. He may announce whichever p he likes at the presidential debate to alter\nhis payo f(p). Because the news cycle is only twenty-four hours, voters will not remember which p he announced\nwhen they go to the polls (i.e., they cannot punish him for being wrong or reward him for being right). Which p does\nCharles choose?\n5. (8 points) As in question 4, Charles is no longer necessarily truthful and can announce any p in the debate. Now\nsuppose that his announcement of p a ects Congress' decision today about whether or not to set up sea walls to\nprotect the coast. The sea walls are free, will guarantee Charles's re-election, but will only be installed if climate\nchange is likely to be very, very, very, very, very, very bad--specifcally, if and only if Charles's announcement satisfes\np ≤ θ < 1.\nTaking p as given, for which values of θ will Charles announce p = θ?\n6. (5 points) Fix θ and the (true) p. Show that if Charles's discount factor is low enough (low δ), he will always lie and\nreport p = 1 no matter what.\n\nPart 2: In Search of Lost Time (40 points)\nNote: Attribution bias will be covered in recitation on April 23 and 24.\nMarcel travels between Paris and Balbec. Denote his location at each moment t by st 2 {0, 1}, where 0 is Paris and 1\nis Balbec. At each moment t, he always does one of two things: spend time with his friend, Albertine (at = 0), or attempt\nto write his novel (at = 1).\nMarcel's instantaneous utility u(at, st) depends on\n(\n-at -2(1 -at) if st = 0\nu(at, st) =\n(1)\n5(1 -at)\nif st = 1.\nDue to his unusual childhood, Marcel su ers from attribution bias based on his location. In moment t, he imagines\nthat his utility for action a at all moments ≥ t will equal\nuˆt(a , s ) = (1 - )u(a , s ) + u(a , st-1(a )),\n(2)\nfor some 2 [0, 1], where st-1(a) ≡{s ∗ : ∗ = max{t0 ≤ (t -1) : at0 = a}} is the last place that he took action a prior\nto t.\n1. (5 points) Interpret Marcel's instantaneous utility function. Which action at does Marcel prefer when he is in Paris?\nWhich does he prefer in Balbec? Where would he rather be?\n2. (5 points) Interpret Marcel's imagination of his utility in future periods. What does measure? What special cases\ndo = 0 and = 1 represent?\n3. (12 points) Marcel now faces a conundrum at t. He is in Paris, and has just received a letter from Albertine. She has\nwritten to tell him that she will only continue to spend time with him if they marry. In this case, Marcel must then\nspend all of his time with her.\nIn addition, sea level rise has made future trips to Balbec impossible, so Marcel is stuck in Paris forever (s = 0 for\nall ≥ t).\nMarcel is utility-maximizing; specifcally, he will choose the course of action that maximizes the utility ˆut(a , s ),\nwhich is the utility that he imagines he will have in each moment > t for the rest of his life.\n1. If Marcel most recently spent time with Albertine in Paris and attempted to write his novel in Paris, will he\npropose the marriage? Does your answer depend on ? Why (not)?\n2. If Marcel most recently spent time with Albertine in Paris and attempted to write his novel in Balbec, will he\npropose? Does your answer depend on ? Why (not)?\n3. If Marcel most recently spent time with Albertine in Balbec and attempted to write his novel in Paris, will he\npropose? Does your answer depend on ? Why (not)?\n4. If Marcel most recently spent time with Albertine in Balbec and attempted to write his novel in Balbec, will he\npropose? Does your answer depend on ? Why (not)?\n4. (8 points) In which of the above cases (if any) would you say Marcel makes a mistake (defned as: being better o\nhad he made a di erent choice)? And if he does make a mistake, do you think he will ever realize this mistake? Can\nyou think of potential policies that Marcel's mother could impose to help her son avoid such mistakes?\nPart 2, continued. Time Regained.\nBefore Marcel can reply to her letter, he receives news that Albertine has died in an unfortunate horseback-riding\naccident.\nNow that he has to write his novel, Marcel faces a new conundrum in every moment t: should he work hard to write\nhis novel (wt = 1), or daydream about being a famous writer, but in fact do nothing (wt = 0)?\nWith Albertine out of the picture, Marcel's preferences have changed.\nHis short but vivid memory means that he values what he does at t based on what he remembers doing at t-1. That\nis, Marcel's instantaneous utility at moment t depends on his choice wt and his state st, where the state is now his\nprevious action (st = wt-1).

      "content": "MIT 14.13 - Problem Set 5\nPlease make sure to explain your answers carefully and concisely, i.e. do not simply write a numerical answer without\nan explanation of how you arrived at this answer. Answers without adequate explanation will not receive full credit.\nPart 1: Climate change denial (40 points)\nClimate change arrives tomorrow. It will either be very bad (event A) or very, very, very, very, very, very bad (not\nA). Today, it is common knowledge that climate change will only be \"very bad\" with probability p 2 [0, 1].\nCharles is the President of France. Elections are the day after tomorrow. Charles discounts with a constant daily\nfactor δ 2 (0, 1) and his utility depends only on his re-election. If he is re-elected, Charles obtains utility of -4 (it is hard\nwork to be president!). If he loses the election, Charles obtains -8.\nHis Facebook advertising team has used sophisticated machine learning techniques to determine that he will be re-\nelected if climate change is very bad, but not if climate change is very, very, very, very, very, very bad (his key constituents\nare located in coastal regions).\n1. (5 points) What is Charles's expected utility today?\nSolution: Charles's expected utility is\nδ2E[u(election result)] = pδ2 u(re-elected) + (1 -p)δ2 u(not re-elected) = pδ2 ·\n(-4) + (1 -p)δ2 ·\n(-8) = δ24(p -2).\n2. (12 points) Charles always tells the truth. He knows he will get questions today in the presidential debate about his\nview on the probability p of very bad climate change. These questions a ect his utility today, which is now given in\nexpectation by\nf(p) + δ2E[u(election result)].\nIn particular, he knows that if climate change seems likely to be very, very, very, very, very, very bad, Charles will\nget a lot of touch questions about his current government's response. So f(p) is increasing in p.\nMIT climate researchers in Building 54 have discovered whether climate change will be very bad or very, very, very,\nvery, very, very bad. Their Nature paper is embargoed until tomorrow, but Charles can email them this morning to\nfnd out the results of their discovery.\nSuppose f(p) = ln(1 + p). Will Charles email the MIT researchers? Does this depend on δ? Does this depend on\nCharles's payo s from re-election?\nSolution: If Charles doesn't learn about climate change, his utility is\nf(p) -(1 -p)δ28 -pδ24\nIf Charles emails them, his expected utility will be\n\np f(1) -4δ2\n+ (1 -p) f(0) -8δ2\n.\n\nHe's better o from learning if\npf(1) + (1 -p)f(0) > f(p),\n(?)\nwhich is satisfed if in particular f is convex. However, f = ln(1+p) is concave, so Charles is \"information-averse.\"\nHe dislikes certainty of a bad state (p = 0), and the possible certainty of a good state is not enough to o set this,\nso he prefers uncertainty. Therefore he will not email the researchers.\nNote that (?) does not depend on either δ or Charles's payo s from winning or losing the election, so neither does\nCharles's choice!\n3. (5 points) Now suppose instead f(p) = (1 + p)2. Will Charles email the MIT researchers? Does this depend on δ?\nDoes this depend on Charles's payo s from re-election?\nSolution: The same argument from the previous part shows that Charles emails the research team if f is convex;\nhere, f = (1 + p)2 is convex. Therefore he will email the researchers. As before, this does not depend on either δ\nor his payo s from winning or losing the election.\n4. (5 points) Now suppose Charles can lie. He may announce whichever p he likes at the presidential debate to alter\nhis payo f(p). Because the news cycle is only twenty-four hours, voters will not remember which p he announced\nwhen they go to the polls (i.e., they cannot punish him for being wrong or reward him for being right). Which p does\nCharles choose?\nSolution: Charles will lie and choose p = 1 because f(p) is increasing.\n5. (8 points) As in question 4, Charles is no longer necessarily truthful and can announce any p in the debate. Now\nsuppose that his announcement of p a ects Congress' decision today about whether or not to set up sea walls to\nprotect the coast. The sea walls are free, will guarantee Charles's re-election, but will only be installed if climate\nchange is likely to be very, very, very, very, very, very bad--specifcally, if and only if Charles's announcement satisfes\np ≤ θ < 1.\nTaking p as given, for which values of θ will Charles announce p = θ?\nSolution: Note that Charles would never announce p < θ, because f(p) is increasing in p. He either announces\np = 1 as in the previous part, or p = θ to ensure the sea walls are built.\nCharles's payo to p = 1 is\nf(1) + δ2E[election] = f(1) + δ2 [p · (-4) + (1 -p)(-8)] .\nCharles's payo to p = θ is\nf(θ) + δ2 [p · (-4) + (1 -p)(-4)]\nand the beneft of extreme lying (saying p = 1) over moderate lying (reporting θ) is\nf(1) -4δ2(1 -p) -f(θ)\nso that Charles will announce p = θ whenever θ satisfes\nf(θ) > f(1) -4δ2(1 -p).\n6. (5 points) Fix θ and the (true) p. Show that if Charles's discount factor is low enough (low δ), he will always lie and\nreport p = 1 no matter what.\nPage 2\n\nSolution: From before, we know that Charles will lie and say that p = 1 if\nf(θ) < f(1) -4δ2(1 -p),\nwhich holds in particular if\ns\nf(1) -f(θ)\nδ <\n.\n4(1 -p)\nPart 2: In Search of Lost Time (40 points)\nNote: Attribution bias will be covered in recitation on April 23 and 24.\nMarcel travels between Paris and Balbec. Denote his location at each moment t by st 2 {0, 1}, where 0 is Paris and 1\nis Balbec. At each moment t, he always does one of two things: spend time with his friend, Albertine (at = 0), or attempt\nto write his novel (at = 1).\nMarcel's instantaneous utility u(at, st) depends on\n(\n-at -2(1 -at) if st = 0\nu(at, st) =\n(1)\n5(1 -at)\nif st = 1.\nDue to his unusual childhood, Marcel su ers from attribution bias based on his location. In moment t, he imagines\nthat his utility for action a at all moments ≥ t will equal\nuˆt(a , s ) = (1 - )u(a , s ) + u(a , st-1(a )),\n(2)\nfor some 2 [0, 1], where st-1(a) ≡{s ∗ : ∗ = max{t0 ≤ (t -1) : at0 = a}} is the last place that he took action a prior\nto t.\n1. (5 points) Interpret Marcel's instantaneous utility function. Which action at does Marcel prefer when he is in Paris?\nWhich does he prefer in Balbec? Where would he rather be?\nSolution: Marcel is always happier in Balbec than in Paris; i.e., he prefers either action in Balbec than either\naction in Paris.\nHe prefers spending time with Albertine (on the beach) to writing his novel when he is Balbec, whereas he prefers\nwriting his novel to spending time with Albertine when he is in Paris.\nOne interpretation of Marcel's utility function is that his enjoyment of Albertine is more sensitive to his location\nthan his enjoyment of attempting to write his novel.\n2. (5 points) Interpret Marcel's imagination of his utility in future periods. What does measure? What special cases\ndo = 0 and = 1 represent?\nSolution: captures Marcel's degree of attribution bias. That is, measures how much weight Marcel puts\non his location st-1 when predicting his utility in current or future locations. The larger the , the stronger is\nhis attribution bias. If = 0, then Marcel has rational expectations, i.e. no attribution bias at all. If = 1,\nthen Marcel has complete attribution bias, i.e. he does not take into account at all the fact that his current or\nfuture locations are di erent from his past locations (and the infuence of these locations on how much enjoys the\nactions he takes).\n3. (12 points) Marcel now faces a conundrum at t. He is in Paris, and has just received a letter from Albertine. She has\nwritten to tell him that she will only continue to spend time with him if they marry. In this case, Marcel must then\nspend all of his time with her.\nPage 3\n\nIn addition, sea level rise has made future trips to Balbec impossible, so Marcel is stuck in Paris forever (s = 0 for\nall ≥ t).\nMarcel is utility-maximizing; specifcally, he will choose the course of action that maximizes the utility ˆut(a , s ),\nwhich is the utility that he imagines he will have in each moment > t for the rest of his life.\n1. If Marcel most recently spent time with Albertine in Paris and attempted to write his novel in Paris, will he\npropose the marriage? Does your answer depend on ? Why (not)?\n2. If Marcel most recently spent time with Albertine in Paris and attempted to write his novel in Balbec, will he\npropose? Does your answer depend on ? Why (not)?\n3. If Marcel most recently spent time with Albertine in Balbec and attempted to write his novel in Paris, will he\npropose? Does your answer depend on ? Why (not)?\n4. If Marcel most recently spent time with Albertine in Balbec and attempted to write his novel in Balbec, will he\npropose? Does your answer depend on ? Why (not)?\nSolution:\n1. Marcel does not propose the marriage, and his answer doesn't depend on . This is because his most recent\nmemories were formed in the same state as the state he will be in forever (i.e., st-1(a ) = st (Paris) for all\na ), so\nuˆt(a , s ) = (1 - )u(a , s ) + u(a , st-1(a )) = u(a , s )\nand he perfectly predicts his utility.\n2. Marcel considers his predicted utility for the two options:\nuˆt(Albertine, Paris) = (1 - ) · u(Albertine, Paris) + · u(Albertine, Paris)\n= (1 - ) · (-2) + · (-2)\n= -2\nand\nuˆt(novel, Paris) = (1 - ) · u(novel, Paris) + · u(novel, Balbec)\n= (1 - ) · (-1) + · 0\n= -1\nand -2 < -1 for all 2 [0, 1] so Marcel writes his novel and does not propose the marriage.\n3. Marcel considers his predicted utility for the two options:\nuˆt(Albertine, Paris) = (1 - ) · u(Albertine, Paris) + · u(Albertine, Balbec)\n= (1 - ) · (-2) + · 5\n= 2 -2 + 5 = 7 -2\nand\nuˆt(novel, Paris) = (1 - ) · u(novel, Paris) + · u(novel, Paris)\n= (1 - ) · (-1) + · (-1)\n= -1\nand he imagines that he would like to be married if\n7 -2 > -1 () > 1/7.\nTherefore, Marcel's choice does depend on ; he does not write the novel if and only if > 1\n7 .\nPage 4\n\n4. Marcel considers his predicted utility for the two options:\nuˆt(Albertine, Paris) = (1 - ) · u(Albertine, Paris) + · u(Albertine, Balbec)\n= (1 - ) · (-2) + · 5\n= 2 -2 + 5 = 7 -2\nand\nuˆt(novel, Paris) = (1 - ) · u(novel, Paris) + · u(novel, Balbec)\n= (1 - ) · (-1) + · 0\n= -1\nand he imagines that he would like to be married if\n7 -2 > -1 () > 1/6,\nso Marcel does not write the novel if and only if >\n, and his choice therefore depends on .\nThe intuition of 3 and 4 is that even though Marcel likes writing a novel more than spending time with Albertine\nwhen he is in Paris, the past delightful experience of spending time with Albertine while at the beach in Balbec\ncauses him to dislike writing. He mistakenly attributes his memory of the beach to a preference to not write the\nnovel. As a result, unless this bias (i.e. ) is suyciently small, he will propose marriage, because he thinks he\nlikes Albertine better than writing his novel (and is not suyciently taking into account that he will never return\nto Balbec).\n4. (8 points) In which of the above cases (if any) would you say Marcel makes a mistake (defned as: being better o\nhad he made a di erent choice)? And if he does make a mistake, do you think he will ever realize this mistake? Can\nyou think of potential policies that Marcel's mother could impose to help her son avoid such mistakes?\nSolution:\nIn the future, since Balbec has succumbed to sea level rise, Marcel will be better o attempting to write his novel.\nMarcel will make a mistake (in the sense of being better o had he made a di erent choice) in situation 3 if >\nand in situation 4 if >\n.\nAfter spending time with Albertine in Paris for one period, Marcel will realize his mistake in both cases (3) and\n(4): after one period with Albertine in Paris, Marcel correctly predicts his utility from time with Albertine in\nParis to be -2, which is less than his predicted utility from writing (which is between -1 and 0) for any .\n(Note that an earlier version of the solutions here incorrectly stated that Marcel will not learn about his mistake\nbecause he will only spend time with Albertine going forward, so cannot know that he will su er less if he instead\nattempted to write his novel. However, note that in case (4), Marcel will think he made an even worse mistake\nthan he actually has, because he will always overestimate the beneft of writing in Paris to be -1 > -1, since\nhe last attempted to write in Balbec (and will only ever have last attempted to write in Balbec).\nHis mother could require that Marcel delay his marriage decision until the most recent time he has spent with\nAlbertine and the most recent attempt at writing his novel have both occurred in Paris.\nPart 2, continued. Time Regained.\nBefore Marcel can reply to her letter, he receives news that Albertine has died in an unfortunate horseback-riding\naccident.\nNow that he has to write his novel, Marcel faces a new conundrum in every moment t: should he work hard to write\nhis novel (wt = 1), or daydream about being a famous writer, but in fact do nothing (wt = 0)?\nWith Albertine out of the picture, Marcel's preferences have changed.\nPage 5\n\nHis short but vivid memory means that he values what he does at t based on what he remembers doing at t-1. That\nis, Marcel's instantaneous utility at moment t depends on his choice wt and his state st, where the state is now his\nprevious action (st = wt-1). His utility is given by\n(\n5(1 -wt)\nif st = 1\nu(wt, st) =\n(3)\n-2(1 -wt) -12wt if st = 0.\nFor example, if Marcel daydreamed at t - 1, so that st = 0, then he has become accustomed to daydreaming, so\nwriting incurs a huge cost (-12), whereas being lazy gives him -2.\nDespite his remarkable literary talent, Marcel su ers from projection bias. At time t, he predicts his future utility of\nhis choice w at time > t to be\nuˆt(w , s ) = (1 - ) · u(w , s ) + · u(w , st),\n(4)\nwhere 2 [0, 1].\n5. (5 points) Provide a brief interpretation of Marcel' situation.\n1. Does Marcel enjoy writing?\n2. How does writing today a ect the level of his utility tomorrow?\n3. How does writing today a ect his marginal utility of writing tomorrow?\n4. What kind of good would you say writing is for Marcel?\nSolution:\n1. At each point in time Marcel enjoys daydreaming more than writing.\n2. Writing at t (so that st+1 = 1 rather than st+1 = 0) increases Marcel's level of utility tomorrow. (Conse\nquently, daydreaming (wt = 0) on any given day decreases the level of his utility on the following day, by\nmaking st+1 = 0.)\n3. Writing today increases Marcel's marginal utility of writing to -5 from -10. (Consequently, on any given\nday, Marcel enjoys daydreaming relatively more than writing if he has daydreamed on the previous day\nthan if he hadn't daydreamed on the previous day.)\n4. Not writing (i.e., daydreaming) is an addiction for Marcel.\n6. (5 points) What does measure? Which does it mean for to equal 0? Which does it mean for to equal 1?\nSolution: captures Marcel's degree of projection bias. That is, measures how much weight Marcel puts\non the current (today's) state when predicting his future utility of writing. The larger the , the stronger is\nMarcel's projection bias. If = 0, he has rational expectations and no projection bias at all. If = 1, then he\nis completely projection-biased. He does not take into account at all the fact that his future states are di erent\nfrom his current ones (and the infuence of these states on how much he enjoys daydreaming).\nPart 3: Learning from antibody tests (up to 20 extra credit points)\nNote: This question is optional extra credit.\nSuppose that the fraction of people with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies is 2.8%. Suppose also that there exists a lateral fow\nimmunoassay test, which\n(i) correctly detects the antibody if it is present with probability 2 [0, 1]; and\n(ii) correctly rejects the presence of the antibody if it is not present with probability 2 [0, 1].\nPage 6\n\n1. (4 points) Suppose that = 0.938, and = 0.956, as with the frst FDA-approved antibody test (from Cellex).\nResearchers are sampling the population at random for testing. Pete is chosen and tests positive for the SARS-CoV-2\nantibody. What is the probability that Pete has the antibody?\nSolution: Let A denote the actual presence of antibodies and B denote a positive test result. With Bayes' rule,\nP(A|B)P(A) = P(B|A)P(B) = P(A [ B),\nP(B|A)P(A)\n0.938 · 0.028\nP(A|B) =\n=\nP(B)\n0.028 · 0.938 + (1 -0.028) · (1 -0.956) ˇ 0.380.\n2. (4 points) Let the fraction of people with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies be ˇ 2 [0, 1], instead of just the previous 2.8%.\nStill taking = 0.938 and = 0.956, and still assuming Pete has tested positive, plot the probability that Pete has\nthe antibody as a function of ˇ over the range [0, 2 ].\nSolution:\n3. (4 points) How large does the prevalence ˇ need to be for a positive test to mean that Pete does, in fact, have\nantibodies with probability 93.8%?\n(An approximate answer is fne).\nSolution: We require that\n0.938 =\nˇ\nˇ + (1 -ˇ)(1 - )\nwhich is satisfed for = 0.938 and = 0.956 at approximately ˇ ˇ .415.\n4. (4 points) Now ask four of your friends who are NOT taking 14.13 (or fell asleep during slides 60-61 of lecture 15/16)\nthe question in (1). What is the average of the answers you receive? If your friends get the answer wrong, why do\nyou think that is? What concept discussed in class can explain the mistake?\nSolution: We expect that your friends will overestimate the probability due to \"base-rate neglect\" (see lecture\n15-16, slide 60). We give them a base rate (0.028) and a signal (0.95), and perhaps your friends will put too\nmuch weight on the signal relative to the base rate.\nPage 7\n\n5. (4 points) Now suppose that the government is interested in allowing people to leave quarantine if they test positive\nfor the antibody. In addition, the government wants to implement the policy soon, i.e., when their epidemiology\nmodels predict that 5% of the overall population has the antibody.\nThe government will use the next test approved by the FDA if, when someone tests positive for the antibody, they\nhave the antibody at least 99% of the time.\nSuppose that = = p for this next test. What is the minimum p for which the FDA should certify the test to\nensure the governmental assumption of 99% accuracy described above?\nSolution: We need\n0.05 ·\n.99 ≤ 0.05 · + 0.95 · (1 - )\nwhich, using = , is satisfed for\n(.05 -.99 · .05 + .99 · .95) ≥ .99 · .95\nor\n.99 · .95\np ≥ =\n= 99.947%\n.05 -.99 · .05 + .99 · .95\nPage 8\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n14.13 Psychology and Economics\nSpring 2021\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

Answers without adequate explanation will not receive full\ncredit.\nPart 1: Shoe Shopping (25 points)\nGordon has reference-dependent preferences over pairs of shoes (cs) and money (cm). His utility takes the form:\nu(cs -rs) + v(cm -rm),\nwhere rs is Gordon's reference point for pairs of shoes and rm is his reference point for money. The function u is\ndefned by\n(\n10px\nif x ≥ 0\nu(x) =\np\n-20\n|x| if x < 0\nand the function v is defned by\n(px\nif x ≥ 0\nv(x) =\np\n-2\n|x| if x < 0\nGordon currently has 7 pairs of shoes (1 pair for each day of the week) and $100 in cash.\n1. (3 points) Provide a brief interpretation of Gordon's preferences. In the gain domain (i.e., for cs ≥ rs and\ncm ≥ rm), is he risk-averse, risk-neutral, or risk-loving? In the loss domain (i.e., for cs < rs and cm < rm), is he\nrisk-averse, risk-neutral, or risk-loving? Does he exhibit increasing or diminishing sensitivity?\nSolution: Gordon exhibits reference-dependence, loss aversion (marginal utility is larger to the left of zero\nthan to the right), risk-aversion in the gain domain, and risk-lovingness in the loss domain. His preferences\nsatisfy these properties for shoes and money separately. Since he is risk-averse in the gain domain and\nrisk-loving in the loss domain, we say that he exhibits diminishing sensitivity.\n2. (4 points) Suppose frst that Gordon's reference points refect the status quo, so that rs = 7 and rm = $100.\nGordon is walking down the street when he sees an ad for a pair of Nike shoes priced at p = $20. Is Gordon\nwilling to buy the pair of shoes at this price?\nSolution: Gordon is willing to buy the pair of shoes at p = $20. If Gordon does not buy the pair of\nshoes, then shoe consumption cs and money consumption cm remain at their reference points and his utility\n\nequals zero. So for Gordon to be willing to buy the pair of shoes, we need\np\np\nrs + 1 -rs -2\n|rm -p -rm| ≥0\np\np\n7 + 1 -7 -2\n|100 -20 -100| ≥0\np\np\n1 -2\n20 ≥ 0\np\n10 ≥ 2\n10 ≥ 8.94,\nwhich is true.\n3. (4 points) Gordon continues walking down the street and runs into his friend Kemba. They begin discussing\nshoes, and Gordon learns that Kemba only owns 6 pairs of shoes (1 pair for each weekday and 1 pair for the\nweekend). Now self-conscious about how many shoes he owns, Gordon updates his shoe reference point to rs = 6.\nIs Gordon still willing to buy the advertised Nike shoes at p = $20?\nSolution: Gordon is no longer willing to buy the the pair of shoes at p = $20. For Gordon to be\nwilling to buy the pair of shoes, we need:\n10prs + 2 -rs -2\np\n|rm -p -rm| ≥10prs + 1 -rs + prm -rm\np\np\np\np\n6 + 2 -6 -2\n|100 -20 -rm| ≥10\n6 + 1 -6 +\np\np\np\n2 -2\n20 ≥ 10\np\np\n10(\n2 -1) ≥ 2\n4.14 ≥ 8.94,\nwhich is not true.\n4. (2 points) Compare your answers to questions 2 and 3. If your answers to questions 2 and 3 di er, explain why\nGordon's decision about shoe buying changed.\nSolution: We found that with p = $20, Gordon was willing to buy the pair of shoes before meeting Kemba\nbut was not willing to buy them afterward. Gordon's reference dependence and diminishing sensitivity\nexplain this result. When rs = 7, Gordon's marginal utility from buying the pair of shoes is 10, which is\np\ngreater than the marginal cost of 2\n20. When he revises his reference point to rs = 6, the marginal utility\np\nof buying the pair of shoes becomes 10(\n2 -1), which, because of the concavity of u in the gain domain, is\np\nno longer greater than the marginal cost of 2\n20.\n5. (4 points) Gordon walks some more and runs into his other friend Jaylen. They begin discussing shoes, and\nGordon learns that Jaylen also owns 7 pairs. No longer self-conscious about his shoe consumption, Gordon\nupdates his shoe reference point back to rs = 7. Gordon and Jaylen decide to go to the Nike store to check out\nthe advertised shoes. When Gordon walks into the store, what is his maximum willingness to pay for the pair of\nshoes?\nSolution: Gordon's maximum willingness to pay for the pair of shoes is $25. His maximum\nPage 2\n\nwillingness to pay is the price pmax at which he is indi erent about buying them:\np\np\nrs + 1 -rs -2\n100 -pmax -100 = 0\np\n1 -2ppmax = 0\n2ppmax = 10\nppmax = 5\npmax = 25\n6. (6 points) Gordon enters the Nike store and grabs the pair of shoes o the shelf. He's pleased about his impending\nshoe purchase and is excited to go home and try them out, so he updates his reference points to refect the new\nstatus quo: rs = 8 and rm = $100 -p = $80. Once at the register, Gordon is informed by the cashier that an\nadditional $20 sur-\"charging\" fee applies to his purchase, so that the total price is now p + $20 = $40.\n(a) Is the new total price of $40 less than, equal to, or greater than the maximum willingness to pay that you\nfound when Gordon entered the store in question 5?\n(b) Is Gordon willing to pay the new total price of $40, or does he prefer to leave the store without buying the\nshoes?\nSolution: (a): The new total price of $40 is greater than the maximum willingness to pay of\n$25 that we found when Gordon entered the store in question 5. (b): Even though the new\ntotal price is higher than Gordon's maximum willingness to pay when he entered the store,\nhe is still willing to buy the shoes. With rs = 8 and rm = $80, Gordon's utility from leaving the store\nwithout buying the shoes is:\np\np\n-20\n|rs -1 -rs| +\n100 -rm\np\np\n= -20\n|7 -1 -7| +\n100 -80\np\np\n= -20\n1 +\n= -15.53\nGordon's utility from paying the fee and buying the shoes is:\np\nprs -rs -2\n|rm -20 -rm|\np\np\n=\n8 -8 -2\n|80 -20 -80|\np\np\n=\n0 -2\n= -8.94\nSince -8.94 > -15.53, Gordon gets higher utility from paying the fee and buying the shoes, so he is still\nwilling to buy them.\n7. (2 points) Firms often impose unanticipated fees at the end of a transaction - e.g., service fees and small-order\nfees from food-delivery companies, booking fees on travel websites, and processing fees on secondary ticket\nexchanges like Ticketmaster and StubHub (including for Celtics tickets!). Use your answer to question 6 to\nexplain why frms often fnd it optimal to charge such fees.\nSolution: Question 6 illustrates that surprise fees can increase frms' revenue when consumers exhibit\nreference-dependent preferences. Before consumers begin a transaction, they have some maximum willingness\nto pay (like the $25 we found for Gordon when he entered the store). However, once they decide to make\nthe purchase and put the item in their (real or virtual) shopping cart, they may begin to think as if they\nalready own the item and update their reference points accordingly. They may have a higher willingness\nPage 3\n\nto pay at the new reference points, and may tolerate add-on fees that they wouldn't have accepted at the\nbeginning of the transaction.\nPart 2: Social Preferences and Random Acts of Kindness (15 points)\n1. We're lucky to be studying social preferences during MIT's Random Acts of Kindness Week. The idea of a\nrandom act of kindness is to perform a selfess act to either help or cheer up a random other person (possibly\na stranger), for no reason other than making that person happier. To better understand how random acts of\nkindness might a ect you and others, please do the following (in this order!):\n(a) Pick a random act of kindness (RAK) and a person to whom you might want to perform it. Such random\nacts might include a wide range of actions, including\n(i) sending an encouraging note;\n(ii) expressing your appreciation; or\n(iii) expressing your gratitude to a friend, colleague, former teacher, or family member.\nTry to put some thought into your RAK and try to come up with something that you think could make the\nother person's day. To address any concerns about the coronavirus, try to avoid random acts that require\nphysical contact.\n(b) Predict, on a scale from -5 to 5, how good you would feel after performing a random act of kindness for\nsomeone. On this scale, let -5 correspond to feeling much worse than normal, 0 correspond to feeling no\ndi\nerent than normal, and 5 correspond to feeling much better than normal.\n(c) Predict, on a scale from -5 to 5, how the other person will react. On this scale, let -5 correspond to feeling\nmuch worse than normal, 0 correspond to feeling no di\nerent than normal, and 5 correspond to feeling much better than normal.\n(d) Perform the random act of kindness to the person you picked.\n(e) Think about how good you actually felt after performing the random act of kindness, and place this feeling\non the same scale as in part (b).\n(f) What is your best guess of the other person's reaction after you performed the random act of kindness?\nPlace this reaction on the same scale as in part (c).\n(g) As your written answer to this question, report\n(i) the random act of kindness that you performed,\n(ii) whether your answer to part (e) was greater than, equal to, or less than your answer to part (b),\n(iii) whether your answer to part (f) was greater than, equal to, or less than your answer to part (c).\n(h)\nPage 4\n\nMIT OpenCourseWare\nhttps://ocw.mit.edu\n14.13 Psychology and Economics\nSpring 2021\nFor information about citing these materials or our Terms of Use, visit: https://ocw.mit.edu/terms."

In fact, no amount of impatience\nwill generate the above behavior.\n- Time inconsistency is implicated in both cases.\n- The student ends up doing something that is worse for all selves than another\navailable option.\n- The na ıve student does the problem set in period 2, whereas all selves would be\nbetter o if she did it in period 0.\n- The sophisticated student goes to the movie in period 0, whereas all selves would be\nbetter o if she went in period 3 (or 2).\n- This kind of behavior cannot happen with exponential discounting: later selves\nwould be willing to carry out self 0's optimal plan.\n\nExponential discounting\nEvidence against exponential discounting\nQuasi-hyperbolic discounting\nSophistication vs. na ıvet e\nReferences\nSolving Problems with (Quasi-)Hyperbolic Discounting\n- Na ıve decision-makers:\n(1) Start at the beginning.\n(2) Solve for the optimal plan, assuming future selves will follow the plan.\n(3) The person takes the frst step in that plan.\n(4) Go to the next period, and keep doing the same.\n- Sophisticated decision-makers:\n(1) Start at the end.\n(2) Solve for optimal action.\n(3) Go back to the previous period.\n(4) Solve for the optimal action, taking into account what happens in the next period.\n(5) Go back to the previous period, and keep doing the same.\n- What about partially sophisticated decision-makers with <\nˆ < 1?

They are then told to \"do it a different way\".\n- Subjects struggle until Maier \"accidentally\" put some cords in motion. They then\nfigure out the solution within next 45 seconds.\n4 / 32\n\nMaier's (1931) \"Two-String Problem\"\nDue to copyright restrictions, we aren't able to include the video\n\"Functional Fixedness.\" You can watch the video on YouTube.\nNote: Focus on the first 2.5 minutes of the video.\n5/32\n\nTelling more than we can know\nTwo design tools\nCoherent arbitrariness\nReferences\nHow did you come up with this idea?\n- How did subjects come up with the idea of using a pendulum?\n- \"It just dawned on me.\"\n- \"It was the only thing left.\"\n- \"I just realized the cord would swing if I fastened a weight on it.\"\n- Particularly peculiar answer by Harvard psychology faculty subject:\n- \"Having exhausted everything else, the next thing was to swing it. I thought of the\nsituation of swinging across a river. I had imagery of monkeys swinging from trees.\nThis imagery appeared simultaneously with the solution. The idea appeared\ncomplete.\"\n- But we know that people came up with the idea because Maier made them notice\nit!\n6 / 32\n\nTelling more than we can know\nTwo design tools\nCoherent arbitrariness\nReferences\nExample 2: Presence of others on helping behavior\n- Latane and Darley (1968) experiments on impact of bystanders and witnesses on\nhelping behavior\n- The more people who overhear someone in another room having what sounds like an\nepileptic seizure, the lower the probability that any given individual will rush to help.\n- Similar results for individuals' reaction to dangerous-looking smoke coming out of\nthe ceiling of a room.\n- Yet subjects consistently claim that their behavior had not been influenced by the\nother people present.\n- \"We asked this question every way we knew how: subtly directly, tactfully, bluntly.\nAlways we got the same answer.\"\n- But these are randomized experiments.

position effect: right-most object heavily over-chosen\n- Randomize positioning of items\n- Why did people choose what they chose?\n- No subject ever mentioned the position of the article in the

know\nTwo design tools\nCoherent arbitrariness\nReferences\nBehavior in (rare) contingencies\n- Common interest in experiments: how would people behave in many different\n(rare) contingencies?\n- Why do we care about behavior in rare contingencies?\n- Often such contingencies are inherently important.\n- Examples: disasters, earthquakes, droughts, etc.\n- Events in rare contingencies can affect events in likely contingencies.\n- Example: if your roommates think that you'll punch them in the face if they borrow\nyour stuff without asking, they won't do so.\n- So the punching is rare but important--that's exactly because they don't borrow your\nstuff!\n11 / 32\n\nTelling more than we can know\nTwo design tools\nCoherent arbitrariness\nReferences\nStrategy method\n- The method of eliciting behavior in many, potentially rare, circumstances by\nasking subjects what they would do, with the choice implemented if the\ncircumstance arises.\n- Since the decision does count if the contingency occurs, subjects have an\nincentive to choose correctly for each contingency.\n- Also useful for multiplying the amount of data generated from an experiment.\n- Give a subject many decisions.\n- Ask the subject to make a choice in each.\n- Then, one choice is randomly selected to \"count\".\n- Evidence suggests that strategy methods elicit individuals' \"true preferences\".\n12

random number generator.\n- If the subject's bid is greater than the price, he or she pays the price (not the\nannounced WTP!) and receives the item being auctioned.\n- If the subject's bid is lower than the price, he or she pays nothing and receives\nnothing.\n- Key element: Final price a person must pay is independent of what the person\nindicated as her WTP.\n14 / 32\n\nTelling more than we

YouTube.\n15 / 32\n\nTelling more than we can know\nTwo design tools\nCoherent arbitrariness\nReferences\nMaking it up as we go along\n- Two key components of individual decision-making:\n(1) Utility functions (preferences)--what people want or care about.\n(2) Beliefs--how people perceive themselves and patterns in the world.\n- Understanding these is important because people (presumably) try to act in a way\nthey perceive leads to what they want.\n- Our approach: study preferences and beliefs pretending people are always sharply\naware of what they want and believe, and costlessly make plans based on this.\n- A homeowner may have reference-dependent preferences, but she always knows what\nshe prefers and can act on it.\n- A person may have the wrong theory of the world, but she always has some beliefs in\nmind that she uses to make choices.\n- A smoker may act sub-optimally, but he always has a fully specified strategy in mind\nfor all his current and future decisions.\n16 / 32\n\nTelling more than we can know\nTwo design tools\nCoherent arbitrariness\nReferences\nReality check\n- In reality, we don't have preferences, beliefs, and all possible decisions made up\nand readily available to us at all times.\n- Rather, we construct, reconstruct, and recall these things only at times when\nthey're necessary.\n- The short summary is that people \"make things up as they go along.\"\n- Choices are made one by one based on preferences and beliefs evoked at the moment.\n- These choices are often sensitive to the features of the momentary environment and\nset of options considered.\n17 / 32\n\nTelling more than we can know\nTwo design tools\nCoherent arbitrariness\nReferences\nHumans' search for meaning... and preferences\n- Almost all economic models assume that when making choices, people draw on\nsome well-defined preferences (utility).\n- Assumption so ingrained that we almost never notice or mention it.\n- But often people don't really know how much they (dis)like things.\n- How much is the utility of a 30-inch rather than a 24-inch monitor worth to me?\nNot sure.\n- When asked to make a decision, people try to \"construct\" (make up) their\npreferences on the spot.\n- Because they're fundamentally unsure about their preferences, this construction\nprocess can often be manipulated by even irrelevant cues.\n18 / 32\n\nTABLE

I would like to\nthank them, without implicating them in any way, for sharing their materials with me.\n\nReference dependence\nLabor supply\nHouses\nStocks\nMarathons\nGolf\n(No) Deal\nPrices and frms\nReferences\nRecap: most important points in Kahneman and Tversky (1979)\n(1) Changes rather than levels. Utility seems better described by changes in consumption\nrather than by levels of consumption.\nThe carriers of value are changes in wealth or welfare, rather than fnal states. This assumption is\ncompatible with basic principles of perception and judgment.\n(2) Loss aversion. Losses loom larger than gains.\nThe aggravation that one experiences in losing a sum of money appears to be greater than the\npleasure associated with gaining the same amount.\n(3) Diminishing sensitivity. People are risk-averse in the gain region, but risk-loving in the\nloss region.\nMany sensory and perceptual dimensions share the property that the psychological response is a\nconcave function of the magnitude of physical change. For example, it is easier to discriminate\nbetween a change of 3 degrees and a change of 6 degrees in room temperate, than it is to\ndiscriminate between a change of 13 degrees and a change of 16 degrees.\n\nReference dependence\nLabor supply\nHouses\nStocks\nMarathons\nGolf\n(No) Deal\nPrices and frms\nReferences\nDiminishing sensitivity\n- People's sensitivity to further changes in consumption is smaller for consumption\nlevels that are further away from the reference point.\n- A change from getting $0 to getting $10 feels greater than a change from getting\n$1,000 to getting $1,010.\n- Risk taking in loss domain and risk aversion in gain domain are consistent with\ndiminishing sensitivity.\n- Much like reference dependence, diminishing sensitivity is a general feature of\nhuman perception:\nDistance\n1 ft. vs. 0 ft.\n101 ft. vs. 100 ft.\nTime\n1 day vs. 0 days\n101 days from now vs. 100 days\nChance\n1% vs. 0%\n19% vs. 18%\n\nReference dependence\nLabor supply\nHouses\nStocks\nMarathons\nGolf\n(No) Deal\nPrices and frms\nReferences\n\"Prospect Theory\": proposed alternative utility (value) function\nLoss aversion - diminishing sensitivity\nv(c-r)\nc-r\n(1) Carrier of utility: changes\nrelative to reference point\n(rather than levels)\n(2) Loss aversion: kink at zero\n(3) Diminishing sensitivity:\ndiminishing returns on both\nsides of the reference point\n- Concavity in gains\n- Convexity in losses\n- Key question: how is the\nreference point determined?\n\nReference dependence\nLabor supply\nHouses\nStocks\nMarathons\nGolf\n(No) Deal\nPrices and frms\nReferences\nValue function: example\n- Matthew has reference-dependent utility over shirts (cS ) and money (cM ):\nv(cS -rS ) + v(cM -rM ),\n(1)\nwhere rM is the reference point for money and rS is the reference point for shirts.\n- The 'value function' v(x):\n- (Usually) concave in gain domain (x > 0) and convex in loss domain (x < 0).\n- Kink at zero: v(x) is steeper to the left of x = 0 than to the right of x = 0.\n- Example:\n(px\nfor x > 0,\nv(x) = -2\np\n|x|\nfor x < 0.\n(2)\n\nReference dependence\nLabor supply\nHouses\nStocks\nMarathons\nGolf\n(No) Deal\nPrices and frms\nReferences\nMany applications of reference-dependent utility\n- Endowment e ect: Kahneman et al.
